    "question": "Which bronchoscopic technique offers the highest diagnostic yield for mediastinal lymph node staging in lung cancer?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Conventional Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA)",
      "B": "Endobronchial Ultrasound-guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)",
      "C": "Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)",
      "D": "Transbronchial Lung Biopsy (TBLB)"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "bronchoscopy_basic",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "EBUS-TBNA allows real-time visualization of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, enabling precise needle aspiration under ultrasound guidance. This significantly improves the diagnostic yield and safety compared to conventional TBNA, which relies on anatomical landmarks. It is the gold standard for minimally invasive mediastinal staging in lung cancer.",
    "highYieldPearl": "EBUS-TBNA is superior to conventional TBNA for mediastinal lymph node staging due to real-time ultrasound guidance.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Conventional TBNA (A) is less accurate due to lack of real-time visualization. BAL (C) and TBLB (D) are not primarily used for lymph node staging.",

    "question": "A bronchoalveolar lavage fluid demonstrating significant lymphocytosis with a CD4/CD8 ratio > 3:1 is characteristic of which interstitial lung disease?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis",
      "B": "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis",
      "C": "Sarcoidosis",
      "D": "Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "bronchoscopy_basic",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Sarcoidosis typically presents with a lymphocytic alveolitis, often with a high CD4/CD8 ratio (usually >3.5, but >3:1 is highly suggestive). In contrast, Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis often shows lymphocytosis with a low CD4/CD8 ratio (<1), while IPF typically shows neutrophilia or eosinophilia, and COP often shows mixed cellularity with lymphocytes and neutrophils.",
    "highYieldPearl": "High BAL CD4/CD8 ratio (>3:1) is a strong indicator for sarcoidosis.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (A) also has lymphocytosis but a low CD4/CD8 ratio. IPF (B) and COP (D) do not typically show prominent lymphocytosis with a high CD4/CD8 ratio.",

    "question": "The most frequent serious complication associated with transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) is?",

      "A": "Laryngospasm",
      "B": "Hypoxemia",
      "C": "Pneumothorax",
      "D": "Significant Hemorrhage"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "bronchoscopy_basic",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Pneumothorax is the most common serious complication of TBLB, occurring in 1-5% of cases and often requiring chest tube insertion. Significant hemorrhage, while potentially more life-threatening, occurs less frequently (0.5-2%) and is usually self-limiting or manageable with local measures. Laryngospasm and hypoxemia are generally less frequent and more readily managed during the procedure.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Pneumothorax is the most common serious complication of TBLB, followed by significant hemorrhage.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Significant hemorrhage (D) is also a serious complication but generally less frequent than pneumothorax. Laryngospasm (A) and hypoxemia (B) are often transient and manageable, thus typically not classified as the 'most frequent serious' complications.",

    "question": "What is a primary advantage of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy over conventional forceps biopsy for interstitial lung disease diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Reduced risk of pneumothorax",
      "B": "Smaller tissue samples",
      "C": "Less tissue crush artifact",
      "D": "No need for fluoroscopic guidance"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "bronchoscopy_basic",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy uses a cryoprobe to freeze and extract tissue, resulting in larger, better-preserved samples with significantly less crush artifact compared to conventional forceps biopsies. This improved tissue quality enhances diagnostic yield for diffuse parenchymal lung diseases. While the risk of pneumothorax is comparable or slightly higher, the diagnostic quality is superior.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Cryobiopsy yields larger, less crushed tissue samples, improving diagnostic accuracy for ILD.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Cryobiopsy generally has a comparable or even slightly higher risk of pneumothorax (A) than conventional TBLB. It yields larger (B), not smaller, samples. Fluoroscopic guidance (D) is typically still recommended for cryobiopsy to ensure peripheral lesion targeting and reduce complications.",

      "C": "Assessment of airway hyperresponsiveness",
      "D": "Measurement of lung compliance"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "bronchoscopy_basic",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Bronchial washings and brushings collect cells from the airway lumen and surface. These samples are then sent for cytological examination to detect malignant cells, identify infectious organisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), or assess inflammatory changes. Histopathological analysis (A) requires intact tissue architecture, usually obtained via biopsy. Options C and D are not diagnostic uses of washings/brushings.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Histopathological analysis (A) requires tissue biopsies, not washings/brushings. Options C and D are physiological assessments, not directly related to cellular or microbial analysis from these samples.",
