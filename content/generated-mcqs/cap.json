The trapped air creates a positive pressure within the alveoli at the end of expiration. To initiate a new inspiration, the patient must first generate an inspiratory pressure negative enough to overcome this intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure before any inspiratory flow can occur. This 'threshold load' significantly increases the work of breathing.

    "deepDiveExplanation": "This patient presents with a highly suspicious picture for lung cancer, complicated by significant comorbidities (COPD, ischemic heart disease on dual antiplatelet therapy) which increase procedural risk. In such a scenario, obtaining both a definitive diagnosis and accurate mediastinal staging (N-stage) in a single, minimally invasive procedure is crucial. EBUS-TBNA (B) allows for highly accurate sampling of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. This provides diagnostic tissue (for malignancy) and critical staging information simultaneously, which directly impacts treatment decisions. Compared to TBLB of a peripheral mass (A), EBUS-TBNA for lymph nodes often carries a lower bleeding risk (due to smaller needle size and targeted aspiration rather than tissue avulsion) and can be performed with fewer passes, which is important given the antiplatelet therapy. While TBLB of the mass is an option, it may be less efficient for staging and might have a higher bleeding risk, especially if the mass is deep or requires multiple passes. BAL and bronchial washings (C) have significantly lower diagnostic yield for solid lesions and lymph nodes compared to tissue biopsies, leading to diagnostic delays. Flexible bronchoscopy (D) is not absolutely contraindicated in this setting; rather, it requires careful risk assessment, potential temporary cessation of antiplatelets (if cardiac risk allows), and skilled technique to minimize complications. Therefore, prioritizing EBUS-TBNA for both diagnosis and staging is the most appropriate and comprehensive approach.",

Adding fungal culture to BAL is reasonable, but EBUS-TBNA targets the distinct finding.\nOption B: Thoracoscopic lung biopsy is a more invasive procedure and is typically reserved when less invasive methods, including nodal sampling (EBUS-TBNA), have failed.

Oxygen saturation is a critical vital sign for pneumonia assessment but is not a direct component of the CURB-65 score itself.
