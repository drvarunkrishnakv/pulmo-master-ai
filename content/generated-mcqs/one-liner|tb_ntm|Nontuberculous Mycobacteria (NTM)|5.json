      "A": "One positive sputum culture",
      "B": "Two positive sputum cultures",
      "C": "One positive bronchoalveolar lavage culture",
      "D": "Biopsy showing granulomas"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_ntm",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The ATS/IDSA diagnostic criteria for NTM lung disease require a combination of clinical, radiographic, and microbiological findings. Microbiologically, it typically necessitates at least two separate expectorated sputum samples positive for NTM, or one positive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture, or a biopsy positive for NTM with compatible histopathology.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Remember the '2 sputum OR 1 BAL OR biopsy' rule for microbiological diagnosis of NTM lung disease.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option A (one positive sputum) is insufficient. Option D (biopsy alone) is incomplete without a positive culture from the biopsy. While one positive BAL (C) is also a criterion, two positive sputa (B) is often the more frequently met initial criterion for non-invasive sampling.",

    "topic": "tb_ntm",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), which includes M. avium and M. intracellulare, is the most frequently isolated NTM species from clinical samples and the predominant cause of NTM lung disease worldwide, particularly in immunocompetent individuals.",
    "highYieldPearl": "MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex) is the most common cause of NTM lung disease globally.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",

      "C": "12 months after culture conversion",
      "D": "18 months"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "tb_ntm",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Treatment for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease typically involves a multi-drug regimen (macrolide-based) for a prolonged period. The recommended duration is at least 12 months after the patient achieves culture conversion (i.e., negative sputum cultures).",
    "highYieldPearl": "MAC treatment requires a full year of therapy AFTER culture negativity to prevent relapse.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Shorter durations (A, B) are inadequate and associated with higher rates of relapse and drug resistance. Option D (18 months) might be used in more refractory cases, but 12 months post-conversion is the standard minimum.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "tb_ntm",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Mycobacterium abscessus is well-known for its intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics, including macrolides, particularly due to the inducible erm(41) gene. This resistance makes treatment extremely challenging, often requiring combination therapy with parenteral agents.",
    "highYieldPearl": "M. abscessus is the 'problem child' among NTMs due to its inherent drug resistance, especially to macrolides.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "While other NTMs can develop resistance, M. abscessus has a high degree of intrinsic resistance that complicates therapy from the outset, making it distinct from species like M. kansasii or M. xenopi, which are generally more susceptible to standard regimens.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "tb_ntm",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Defects in the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) pathway lead to impaired macrophage activation and are a major genetic predisposition for severe, often disseminated, NTM infections, particularly in pediatric populations.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
