      "A": "Inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes",

      "C": "Transrepression of inflammatory gene transcription",
      "D": "Increased synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "steroids",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Corticosteroids primarily act by binding to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors, which then translocate to the nucleus. Here, they can either directly bind to glucocorticoid response elements (transactivation) or, more importantly for anti-inflammatory effects, interact with and inhibit other transcription factors like NF-κB and AP-1 (transrepression), thereby downregulating the expression of inflammatory genes.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Transrepression is the key genomic mechanism for corticosteroid anti-inflammatory action, distinct from NSAID action or direct bronchodilation.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option A describes NSAID action. Option B describes bronchodilators like beta-agonists. Option D is the opposite of corticosteroid action. Transrepression is the core mechanism at the genomic level for their anti-inflammatory effects.",

    "question": "What is the primary role of systemic corticosteroids in severe acute asthma exacerbation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Immediate bronchodilation",
      "B": "Reduction of airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness",
      "C": "Mucus plug dissolution",
      "D": "Prevention of bacterial superinfection"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "steroids",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Systemic corticosteroids are crucial in severe acute asthma exacerbations because they reduce the underlying airway inflammation, decrease airway hyperresponsiveness, and prevent relapse. Their effects are not immediate but become evident within hours, complementing the rapid bronchodilation provided by short-acting beta-agonists.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Corticosteroids treat the inflammation in asthma, while bronchodilators treat bronchospasm. Both are critical in severe exacerbations.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option A is the role of bronchodilators (e.g., salbutamol). Option C is not a primary effect. Option D is not their role and antibiotics are not routinely indicated unless infection is suspected.",

      "D": "Cataracts"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "steroids",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Oral candidiasis (thrush) is the most common local adverse effect of inhaled corticosteroids due to local immunosuppression in the oropharynx. This risk can be minimized by using a spacer device and rinsing the mouth with water after inhalation.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Always advise patients to rinse their mouth after using inhaled corticosteroids to reduce the risk of oral candidiasis.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Adrenal suppression, osteoporosis, and cataracts are systemic adverse effects, which are less common with inhaled corticosteroids at standard doses compared to oral systemic corticosteroids, and are not considered 'local' effects.",

      "C": "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis",
      "D": "Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "steroids",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Systemic corticosteroids are generally not recommended for the routine chronic management of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). While they might be used in acute exacerbations, chronic use has not shown benefit and may even be harmful, increasing the risk of adverse events without improving survival or disease progression. In contrast, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, sarcoidosis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis often respond well to and are managed with corticosteroids.",
    "highYieldPearl": "IPF is a fibrotic lung disease where corticosteroids are generally ineffective and potentially harmful for chronic management, unlike inflammatory lung diseases.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "All other options (A, B, D) are conditions where corticosteroids are a mainstay of chronic treatment due to their underlying inflammatory nature. IPF is primarily a fibrotic disease with a different pathogenesis.",

      "C": "10-14 days",
      "D": "3-4 weeks"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "steroids",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Current guidelines (e.g., GOLD) recommend a short course of oral corticosteroids, typically 5-7 days (often 40mg prednisone equivalent daily for 5 days), for acute exacerbations of COPD. This duration has been shown to be as effective as longer courses while reducing the risk of side effects.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Shorter courses (5-7 days) of oral corticosteroids are now preferred for COPD exacerbations to minimize systemic side effects without compromising efficacy.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Older recommendations or practices might suggest longer durations (C, D), but evidence now supports shorter courses (B) for comparable efficacy and reduced side effects. Option A is generally too short to achieve full therapeutic effect.",
