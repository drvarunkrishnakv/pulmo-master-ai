    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "dah",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Hemosiderin-laden macrophages (siderophages) on BAL are the hallmark of DAH, indicating recurrent or ongoing bleeding into the alveolar space. They typically become positive after approximately 48-72 hours of bleeding. A progressively hemorrhagic BAL fluid across sequential aliquots (increasing bloodiness from aliquot 1 to 3-5) is also highly suggestive of active DAH.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Hemosiderin-laden macrophages in BAL confirm alveolar bleeding, a key indicator of DAH.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Lymphocytosis and neutrophilia are non-specific inflammatory findings. Eosinophilia is characteristic of eosinophilic lung diseases. While these can coexist, only hemosiderin-laden macrophages directly indicate prior or ongoing alveolar hemorrhage.",

      "B": "Pulmonary capillaritis",
      "C": "Necrotizing granulomas",
      "D": "Endothelialitis"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "dah",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "In ANCA-associated vasculitides (e.g., Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis, Microscopic Polyangiitis), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage typically results from pulmonary capillaritis. This involves inflammation and necrosis of alveolar capillaries, leading to extravasation of red blood cells into the alveolar spaces. Bland hemorrhage lacks inflammation, while necrotizing granulomas are characteristic of GPA but are not the direct cause of acute DAH, which is capillaritis.",
    "highYieldPearl": "ANCA-associated DAH is primarily due to pulmonary capillaritis, an inflammatory destruction of alveolar capillaries.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Necrotizing granulomas are a feature of GPA, but the *mechanism* of DAH in GPA is capillaritis. Bland hemorrhage is a distinct category of DAH without inflammation. Endothelialitis is a broader term, whereas capillaritis specifically describes alveolar capillary inflammation.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "dah",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "High-dose intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) are the cornerstone of initial therapy for severe DAH secondary to systemic autoimmune diseases or vasculitis. They aim to rapidly suppress the acute inflammatory response. While cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and plasmapheresis are often used as adjunctive or subsequent therapies depending on the underlying cause (e.g., ANCA-vasculitis, Goodpasture's syndrome), corticosteroids provide immediate anti-inflammatory action critical in acute, severe DAH.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Acute severe DAH of autoimmune origin requires high-dose corticosteroids as initial therapy.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and plasmapheresis are vital components of therapy for specific causes of DAH (e.g., ANCA vasculitis, anti-GBM disease), but corticosteroids are almost universally the *first-line* agent for acute inflammatory DAH due to their rapid immunosuppressive effect.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "dah",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "While bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showing progressively bloody fluid and hemosiderin-laden macrophages is highly suggestive and often sufficient for a clinical diagnosis, a lung biopsy demonstrating alveolar hemorrhage with or without capillaritis, bland hemorrhage, or vasculitis is considered the definitive 'gold standard' for histopathological confirmation and differentiation of DAH subtypes.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Lung biopsy provides definitive histopathological diagnosis and subtyping of DAH, making it the gold standard.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "trapAnalysis": "BAL is highly sensitive and frequently used for clinical diagnosis, but it does not provide tissue architecture or definitive subtyping. HRCT shows imaging features (e.g., ground-glass opacities) but is not diagnostic. Serum anti-GBM antibodies are specific for Goodpasture's syndrome, a cause of DAH, but not for DAH in general.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "dah",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Bland DAH refers to hemorrhage without associated inflammation or capillaritis on histological examination. It is commonly observed in conditions causing elevated pulmonary venous pressure, such as severe mitral stenosis or left ventricular failure, as well as in coagulopathies or thrombocytopenia. Microscopic polyangiitis and Granulomatosis with polyangiitis are ANCA-associated vasculitides that cause DAH via capillaritis. SLE can cause DAH, often with capillaritis or vasculitis, making mitral stenosis the most distinct example of bland DAH among the choices.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Bland DAH lacks inflammation; it's often caused by increased pulmonary venous pressure (e.g., mitral stenosis) or coagulopathies.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "The other options (Microscopic polyangiitis, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis) are all associated with inflammatory or vasculitic forms of DAH, not bland hemorrhage. This question tests the understanding of DAH subtypes based on underlying pathology.",
