    "question": "A positive methacholine challenge test is defined by what percentage fall in FEV1 from baseline?",

      "C": "20%",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "bronchoprovocation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The methacholine challenge test assesses airway hyperresponsiveness. A positive test is defined as a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20 or PD20) from baseline after inhaling a specific cumulative dose of methacholine. This threshold is widely accepted for diagnosing asthma when baseline spirometry is normal.",
    "highYieldPearl": "PC20 (Provocative Concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1) is the critical value for a positive methacholine challenge test.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "bronchoprovocation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Absolute contraindications for methacholine challenge testing include recent myocardial infarction or stroke (within 3 months), uncontrolled hypertension, aortic aneurysm, FEV1 < 50% predicted or < 1.0 L, and inability to perform spirometry. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication, and FEV1 65% is not an absolute contraindication.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Patient safety is paramount; severe cardiovascular or respiratory instability precludes bronchoprovocation.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "Many conditions are relative contraindications. Distinguishing absolute from relative is crucial. FEV1 < 50% predicted is an absolute contraindication, while FEV1 65% is not.",

    "question": "Methacholine induces bronchoconstriction primarily by stimulating which receptor type in the airways?",

      "A": "Beta-2 adrenergic receptors",

      "C": "Histamine H1 receptors",
      "D": "Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "bronchoprovocation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Methacholine is a cholinergic agonist that mimics acetylcholine. It directly stimulates muscarinic M3 receptors located on airway smooth muscle cells, leading to increased intracellular calcium and subsequent bronchoconstriction. This mechanism is central to its use in bronchoprovocation testing.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Methacholine's action is via the parasympathetic pathway, directly on muscarinic receptors.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "Distractors represent other common receptor types involved in airway physiology. Understanding the specific mechanism of methacholine is key.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "bronchoprovocation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Bronchoprovocation testing is most useful for confirming or excluding a diagnosis of asthma in individuals who have symptoms suggestive of asthma but whose baseline spirometry (FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1) is within normal limits. If spirometry already shows obstruction or significant reversibility, asthma is often already diagnosed.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Bronchoprovocation helps identify airway hyperresponsiveness when routine lung function tests are normal.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "The test is less useful if asthma is already evident from spirometry. Its value lies in detecting occult airway hyperresponsiveness.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "bronchoprovocation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "If significant bronchospasm occurs during a methacholine challenge, the immediate and most effective treatment is to administer a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) such as nebulized salbutamol (albuterol). This rapidly reverses the induced bronchoconstriction, ensuring patient safety. All other options are either too slow or ineffective for acute reversal.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Always have a bronchodilator readily available for immediate reversal during bronchoprovocation.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Other options are treatments for asthma but not for acute, immediate reversal of induced bronchospasm. The key is rapid action.",
