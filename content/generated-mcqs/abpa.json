Prone positioning is a 'Green bar: Recommended' therapy for severe ARDS. VV-ECMO is a higher intensity treatment appropriate for refractory severe ARDS, positioned at the highest intensity end of the spectrum. Neuromuscular blockade (NMBA) for ARDS has a nuanced recommendation; while the ROSE trial (NEJM 2019) indicated no mortality benefit with early routine use, it still has a role in managing severe ventilator asynchrony or profound hypoxemia in specific circumstances, and the context mentions 'new evidence... warrant update' rather than a strong 'not recommended' bar. Therefore, HFOV is the most definitively 'not recommended' option.",

The elevated plateau pressure (32 cmH₂O) in an emphysematous patient on low PEEP further suggests the presence of significant auto-PEEP.\n\nOption C is accurate: pH 7.25 and PaCO₂ 68 mmHg unequivocally indicate Type II (hypercapnic) respiratory failure.

The provided text explicitly details how in COPD, increased airway resistance and early airway closure during expiration lead to air trapping, dynamic hyperinflation, and increased positive intra-alveolar pressure, known as AutoPEEP. This AutoPEEP significantly increases the 'Total Work of Breathing' (TWOB) because the patient must generate a greater inspiratory pressure drop to overcome this positive end-expiratory pressure before inspiratory airflow can even begin. The text illustrates this by showing that a normal inspiration might require 2 cm H2O effort, whereas with 2 cm H2O AutoPEEP, 4 cm H2O effort is needed. This mechanical load is a primary driver of increased WOB.",
