    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "hp",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is characterized by a combination of Type III (immune complex mediated) and Type IV (cell-mediated/delayed type) hypersensitivity reactions. Type III involves antigen-antibody complexes depositing in the lung, activating complement and attracting neutrophils. Type IV involves T-lymphocyte sensitization to inhaled antigens, leading to granuloma formation and chronic inflammation.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Remember the '3+4' for HP's immunological basis. This combination drives both acute inflammation and chronic granulomatous changes.",

    "trapAnalysis": "Distractors test basic knowledge of hypersensitivity types. Incorrectly associating HP with Type I (IgE-mediated, e.g., asthma) or Type II (cytotoxic, e.g., Goodpasture's) is a common error.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "hp",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The classic histological triad for HP includes lymphocytic bronchiolitis, interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate, and poorly formed, non-caseating granulomas. While honeycombing can be seen in chronic fibrotic HP, it's not the *most characteristic* initial or unique feature. Eosinophilic infiltration is rare, and DAD is more typical of acute lung injury/ARDS.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "BAL in HP typically shows a significant increase in lymphocytes (>20-50% of total cells), particularly T-lymphocytes. In acute/subacute HP, an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio (<1.0) is often observed, although this can normalize or even invert in chronic HP. Neutrophils suggest infection or ARDS, eosinophils suggest eosinophilic pneumonias.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "Chronic HP is characterized by progressive fibrosis, which manifests on HRCT as reticulation, honeycombing, volume loss, and traction bronchiectasis, often with a mid-to-upper lung predominance or patchy distribution. Diffuse ground-glass and centrilobular nodules are more acute/subacute features. Tree-in-bud is typically seen in endobronchial spread of infection.",

While corticosteroids (immunosuppressants) are often used, especially in acute and subacute phases, they are secondary to antigen avoidance in preventing disease progression and recurrence.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "hp",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "HP primarily affects the interstitium and small airways, leading to a restrictive ventilatory defect characterized by reduced FVC and TLC. DLCO is also typically decreased due to inflammation and fibrosis affecting the gas exchange surface. Air trapping may sometimes lead to a mixed picture, but restrictive is the predominant pattern.",

Evidence of antigen exposure, either through history or specific antibody tests, is crucial for establishing causality. PPD for TB, IgE for Type I reactions, and eosinophilia for allergic conditions are not primary for HP.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "hp",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "While both chronic HP and IPF can show fibrosis and honeycombing, IPF classically has a basal-predominant, subpleural distribution of honeycombing. Chronic HP often shows mosaic attenuation (due to small airway disease and air trapping) and relative sparing of lung bases, with fibrosis often more patchy or mid-to-upper lung predominant. Extensive ground-glass is more acute HP. Mosaic attenuation/air trapping is a key differentiator from IPF.",
