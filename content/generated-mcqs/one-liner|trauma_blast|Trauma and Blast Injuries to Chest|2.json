    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "trauma_blast",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Primary blast injury (PBI) is caused by the direct impact of the blast pressure wave on tissues. Air-filled organs like the lungs (blast lung), ears (tympanic membrane rupture), and gastrointestinal tract are most susceptible due to the impedance mismatch between air and tissue, leading to shear forces and tissue damage. Blast lung is characterized by contusions, hemorrhage, and air emboli.",
    "highYieldPearl": "PBI is unique to blast events; secondary, tertiary, and quaternary injuries can occur in other trauma types.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Options A, B, and D represent secondary, tertiary, and quaternary blast injuries, respectively. Candidates might confuse the primary mechanism with other commonly recognized blast injury types.",

    "question": "What is the definitive management for a tension pneumothorax?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chest tube thoracostomy",
      "B": "Needle decompression",
      "C": "Supplemental oxygen",
      "D": "Urgent surgical exploration"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "trauma_blast",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention. While needle decompression (often via a large-bore cannula in the 2nd intercostal space midclavicular line or 4th/5th intercostal space anterior axillary line) is a life-saving *initial* temporizing measure to relieve pressure, the *definitive* management involves inserting a chest tube (thoracostomy) to continuously drain air and re-expand the lung.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Needle decompression converts a tension pneumothorax into a simple pneumothorax, allowing time for definitive chest tube placement.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option B (Needle decompression) is a common trap as it is the critical *initial* step. However, the question asks for *definitive* management, which is the chest tube. Surgical exploration (D) is rarely indicated for simple tension pneumothorax unless there's associated massive hemorrhage or complex injury.",
