    "deepDiveExplanation": "Adenocarcinoma has surpassed squamous cell carcinoma as the most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and overall lung cancer, accounting for approximately 40% of cases. Its incidence has increased, particularly in women and non-smokers, and it is often found peripherally.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "Active cigarette smoking is unequivocally the strongest risk factor for lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85-90% of all cases. The risk is dose-dependent, increasing with the number of cigarettes smoked and duration of smoking. Cessation significantly reduces risk over time.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "Secondhand smoke is also a significant risk factor for non-smokers, but radon generally accounts for more cases. Asbestos is a strong occupational risk, and air pollution is a broader environmental risk, but radon takes precedence as the 'second leading cause'.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "lung_cancer_epi",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The risk of lung cancer from radon exposure is significantly multiplied (synergistic effect) in individuals who also smoke cigarettes. For example, a smoker exposed to radon has a much higher risk than the sum of risks from smoking alone and radon alone.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Radon exposure plus smoking creates a powerful synergistic risk, not merely additive, for lung cancer.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "While all options might increase risk in some context, the synergistic interaction (where the combined effect is greater than the sum of individual effects) is a classic finding for radon and smoking. Asbestos also has a synergistic effect with smoking, but it was not an option here.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has the strongest association with cigarette smoking, with over 95% of SCLC cases occurring in current or former smokers. It is rare in never-smokers. Squamous cell carcinoma also has a very strong link but is not as exclusively tied to smoking as SCLC.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lung_cancer_epi",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Several large randomized controlled trials (e.g., CARET, ATBC) demonstrated that high-dose beta-carotene supplementation actually increased the risk of lung cancer (and cardiovascular mortality) in active heavy smokers and asbestos-exposed individuals, contrary to initial hopes of a protective effect.",

The chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and repetitive injury-repair cycles in the fibrotic lung are thought to contribute to malignant transformation. The lifetime risk of lung cancer in IPF patients is estimated to be 5-10 times higher than the general population.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "Passive smoking (exposure to secondhand smoke) is an established cause of lung cancer, with an estimated 20-30% increased risk for non-smokers exposed to it. Epidemiological studies suggest that adenocarcinoma is the most commonly observed histological subtype in lung cancers linked to passive smoking, mirroring the pattern seen in never-smokers who develop lung cancer.",
