    "question": "Which HRCT pattern is considered diagnostic for Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) in the absence of other causes?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Predominant ground-glass opacity",
      "B": "Subpleural and basal predominant reticular opacities with honeycombing",
      "C": "Upper lobe predominant centrilobular nodules",
      "D": "Diffuse crazy-paving pattern"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "thoracic_ct",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines define a 'UIP pattern' on HRCT by the presence of honeycombing (often subpleural and basal predominant) with or without peripheral traction bronchiectasis/bronchioloectasis, and reticular abnormality. Ground-glass opacity, if present, should be less extensive than reticular abnormality. Absence of features inconsistent with UIP is also crucial.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Honeycombing is the most specific HRCT feature for UIP and is diagnostic in the appropriate clinical context.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option A (ground-glass) is non-specific. Option C (centrilobular nodules) suggests hypersensitivity pneumonitis or bronchiolitis. Option D (crazy-paving) is characteristic of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.",

      "C": "Sarcoidosis",
      "D": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "thoracic_ct",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The 'signet ring sign' on HRCT refers to a dilated bronchus (the 'ring') adjacent to its accompanying pulmonary artery (the 'gemstone'), where the bronchus lumen is wider than the accompanying artery. This indicates bronchial dilatation, a hallmark of bronchiectasis.",
    "highYieldPearl": "A bronchial lumen larger than its accompanying pulmonary artery is the primary CT criterion for bronchiectasis.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Other options are diffuse lung diseases with different characteristic CT features. Emphysema involves parenchymal destruction, sarcoidosis involves perilymphatic nodules, and IPF involves honeycombing.",

      "A": "Soft tissue mass",
      "B": "Active consolidation",
      "C": "Emphysematous changes",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "thoracic_ct",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Hounsfield Units (HU) quantify tissue density on CT. Air is -1000 HU, water is 0 HU, and bone is +1000 HU. Values between -800 and -900 HU represent significantly decreased tissue density, characteristic of air-filled spaces without normal lung parenchyma, such as in emphysema.",
    "highYieldPearl": "HU values correlate directly with tissue density: lower (more negative) values indicate less dense tissue (e.g., air), higher (more positive) values indicate denser tissue (e.g., calcification, bone).",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Soft tissue masses are typically +20 to +70 HU. Active consolidation is around +30 to +70 HU. Calcified nodules are much higher, typically +100 to +1000 HU.",

      "C": "Stable size over two years",
      "D": "Solid enhancement exceeding 20 HU"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "thoracic_ct",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "A pulmonary nodule stable in size (no change in diameter of 2mm or more) for at least two years is generally considered benign, especially if it's solid. Malignant nodules typically grow, with a doubling time of 20 to 400 days.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Stability over 2 years is a strong indicator of benignity for solid pulmonary nodules. This timeframe is extended to 5 years for subsolid nodules.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Spiculated margins, rapid doubling time (less than 30 days is too fast for most primary lung cancers, often suggesting infection or metastasis; however, any growth is suspicious), and significant enhancement are features more commonly associated with malignancy.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "thoracic_ct",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The 'tree-in-bud' pattern represents centrilobular branching linear opacities with associated small nodules, resembling a budding tree branch. It results from impaction of inflamed or infected material within small airways and their distal branches, commonly seen in mycobacterial infections, bacterial bronchiolitis, or aspiration.",
    "highYieldPearl": "While infection is the most common cause, 'tree-in-bud' can also be seen in non-infectious conditions like cystic fibrosis, aspiration, or even occasionally in neoplastic conditions like bronchioalveolar carcinoma.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Lymphangitic carcinomatosis typically presents with smooth or nodular septal thickening. Pulmonary edema shows diffuse ground-glass or consolidation with septal lines. Alveolar proteinosis classically presents with crazy-paving pattern.",

    "topic": "thoracic_ct",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Chronic pulmonary embolism (CPE) or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is characterized by organized thrombus that remodels the vessel wall. Webs, bands, intimal irregularities, and recanalized channels are specific signs of chronic thrombus on CT angiography.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Acute PE presents as a central, low-attenuation filling defect forming acute angles with the vessel wall, whereas chronic PE shows signs of organization and remodelling.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Acute intraluminal filling defect is characteristic of acute PE. Mosaic attenuation can be seen in various conditions causing air trapping or perfusion abnormalities. Right ventricular enlargement is a sign of pulmonary hypertension, which can be acute or chronic.",

These findings often have an upper or mid-lung predominance.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "thoracic_ct",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "CT angiography (CTA) of the chest and abdomen is the gold standard for diagnosing acute aortic dissection. It accurately identifies the intimal flap separating the true and false lumens, characterizes the extent of dissection, and detects complications like branch vessel involvement or rupture.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
