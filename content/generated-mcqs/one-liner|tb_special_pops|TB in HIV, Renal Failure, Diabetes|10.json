    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "tb_special_pops",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "For most drug-susceptible pulmonary TB cases in HIV-infected individuals, the standard 6-month regimen (2 months HRZE, 4 months HR) is recommended, similar to HIV-negative individuals, provided there is no severe disease, extensive cavitation, or CNS involvement. This approach is supported by evidence showing similar efficacy.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "tb_special_pops",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "WHO guidelines recommend initiating ART within 2 weeks of starting anti-TB treatment for HIV-TB co-infected patients with CD4 counts less than 50 cells/µL. This early initiation significantly reduces mortality, despite a higher risk of TB-IRIS. For CD4 counts 50-200 cells/µL, ART initiation is recommended within 2-8 weeks.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "tb_special_pops",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Ethambutol is primarily renally excreted, and its dose must be adjusted in patients with renal impairment to prevent accumulation and potential optic neuritis. Pyrazinamide also requires dose adjustment in renal failure, but Ethambutol is a classic example highlighted for renal dose adjustment among the first-line drugs. Isoniazid and Rifampicin are predominantly metabolized by the liver, requiring less adjustment.",

While all aminoglycosides (Kanamycin, Amikacin) and Capreomycin (a polypeptide antibiotic with a similar toxicity profile) are problematic in renal failure, Streptomycin is the classical first-generation injectable anti-TB drug and is generally contraindicated or used with extreme caution and significant dose reduction in severe renal impairment, often requiring therapeutic drug monitoring.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "tb_special_pops",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Rifampicin is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4), which significantly accelerates the metabolism of many Protease Inhibitors (PIs) and Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs). This interaction leads to subtherapeutic PI/NNRTI levels, potentially causing HIV treatment failure and development of resistance. This drug-drug interaction is a major challenge in HIV-TB co-management.",

The altered glucose metabolism and impaired local immunity contribute to this predilection.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "tb_special_pops",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Ethambutol is primarily renally excreted and is dialyzable. To ensure adequate drug levels and minimize toxicity (especially optic neuritis), it is typically administered thrice weekly immediately after hemodialysis sessions, which is captured by the 'Post-dialysis' instruction. This ensures drug removal during dialysis does not lead to subtherapeutic levels before the next dose.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "tb_special_pops",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Isoniazid can cause peripheral neuropathy due to its interference with pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) metabolism. HIV-infected patients are already at a higher risk for neuropathy from HIV itself or from other antiretroviral drugs, making co-administration of pyridoxine crucial when Isoniazid is used in this population.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_special_pops",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Immunocompromised states, such as advanced HIV infection or severe renal failure, lead to an impaired cellular immune response (anergy).
