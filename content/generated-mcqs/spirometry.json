It typically results from a delayed-type hypersensitivity (Type IV) reaction to mycobacterial antigens that enter the pleural space, usually following the rupture of a subpleural caseous focus (Ghon's focus) or leakage from an adjacent lymph node.

    "deepDiveExplanation": "The Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) maneuver involves a maximal forced exhalation after a maximal inspiration. This maneuver generates flow-volume and volume-time curves, from which dynamic lung volumes (like FEV1, FVC) and flow rates (like PEF, FEF25-75%) are derived. SVC, IC, and VT are measures of static or resting lung volumes/capacities, though SVC is a maximal exhalation, it's performed slowly, not forcibly, thus not assessing dynamic flows.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "spirometry",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "An acceptable start to a forced expiratory maneuver requires a 'good blast' – a rapid, forceful exhalation with no hesitation, coughing, or false starts before the peak flow is achieved. This ensures that the FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second) accurately reflects the maximal initial airflow. Other options are criteria for the end of the test or overall maneuver quality, not specifically the start.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "While achieving peak flow quickly is important, the 'no hesitation' aspect is the fundamental criterion for the *start* of the maneuver. A cough or hesitation at the beginning can significantly invalidate the FEV1.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "spirometry",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "According to ATS/ERS standards, a spirometry test is considered valid if at least three acceptable maneuvers are performed. From these, the two best maneuvers (with the highest sum of FEV1 and FVC) must meet repeatability criteria (FEV1 and FVC within 150 mL of each other). While up to eight maneuvers may be performed, three acceptable ones are the minimum to ensure reproducibility and reliability.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Students might confuse the 'two repeatable' with the 'minimum acceptable' total. You need at least three acceptable maneuvers to ensure you can select two that meet repeatability criteria.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "spirometry",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "A variable extrathoracic obstruction (e.g., vocal cord dysfunction, goiter compressing trachea) is worse during inspiration when negative intrathoracic pressure collapses the airway, leading to a flattened inspiratory limb. During expiration, positive intrathoracic pressure tends to hold the airway open, so the expiratory limb remains relatively normal. Fixed obstructions flatten both limbs, and variable intrathoracic obstructions affect the expiratory limb more.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Flattened inspiratory, normal expiratory limb = variable extrathoracic obstruction.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",

    "question": "Which spirometric finding suggests air trapping when compared to FVC?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increased FEV1/FVC ratio",

      "C": "Increased RV/TLC",
      "D": "Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) significantly greater than FVC"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "spirometry",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Air trapping occurs when air is retained in the lungs due to airway collapse during forced exhalation, often seen in obstructive diseases. When a patient exhales slowly (SVC), airways are less likely to collapse, allowing more complete emptying of the lungs. Thus, if SVC is significantly greater than FVC (usually >200mL or >10%), it suggests air trapping. Increased RV/TLC is a definite sign of air trapping/hyperinflation but is measured by plethysmography, not spirometry.",
    "highYieldPearl": "SVC > FVC suggests air trapping, indicating dynamic airway collapse.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "While increased RV/TLC definitively indicates air trapping/hyperinflation, it is not a spirometric parameter. The question asks for a 'spirometric finding'. The difference between SVC and FVC is a key spirometric indicator of air trapping.",
