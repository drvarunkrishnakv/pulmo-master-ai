    "question": "A 45-year-old male with moderate ARDS is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Despite a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg ideal body weight, his plateau pressure is consistently at 28 cm H2O, and driving pressure remains 18 cm H2O. The arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.20 with a PaCO2 of 75 mmHg.

What is the primary objective of introducing ECCO2R in this patient?",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "Pulmonary Hypertension - Treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The primary objective of ECCO2R in ARDS is to manage acute hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis that can arise from lung-protective mechanical ventilation, especially when employing ultra-protective strategies (tidal volumes < 6 mL/kg). This enables clinicians to further reduce tidal volume and optimize driving pressure and plateau pressure, thereby minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). While ECCO2R can indirectly impact oxygenation by improving V/Q matching and systemic hemodynamics by correcting acidosis, its main goal is to facilitate safer ventilation strategies. The text explicitly states, 'the main treatment goal of ECCO2R therapy in patients with ARDS was to carry out ultraprotective lung ventilation through handling CO2 levels.'",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rio's Take: ECCO2R's main role in ARDS is to 'buy' the ability to use ultra-protective lung ventilation (lower VT, optimize driving/plateau pressure) by controlling hypercapnia, not primarily to improve oxygenation or treat PH.",

      "B": "This is a plausible but incorrect primary objective. While ECCO2R can indirectly improve V/Q matching and thus oxygenation by allowing more optimal ventilation settings, its direct and primary effect is CO2 removal, not oxygenation improvement. The text mentions ECCO2R for CO2 removal, not as an oxygenation device.",
      "C": "This is a secondary benefit, not the primary objective. While hypercapnia can cause pulmonary hypertension and acidosis can affect cardiac function, the text emphasizes ECCO2R's role in facilitating ULPV and managing CO2 levels to optimize driving/plateau pressure, not primarily as a PH treatment.",
      "D": "This is partially correct but not the *primary* objective as stated. ECCO2R facilitates reducing VILI by allowing lower VT and thus lower driving pressure (which is linked to Pplat), but the direct mechanism described is handling CO2 levels to enable *ultra-protective lung ventilation*, which is a more comprehensive goal than just reducing peak inspiratory pressures."
