    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "lung_volumes",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Residual Volume (RV) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. Since it cannot be exhaled, it cannot be measured by simple spirometry. Consequently, capacities that include RV (Functional Residual Capacity and Total Lung Capacity) also cannot be directly measured by spirometry.",
    "highYieldPearl": "RV, FRC, and TLC require indirect methods such as helium dilution, nitrogen washout, or body plethysmography for measurement.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Students might confuse volumes directly measured with capacities that include RV, like FRC or TLC, which are also not directly measured but are derived from RV.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lung_volumes",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Body plethysmography measures FRC by applying Boyle's law (P1V1=P2V2). It measures all gas in the chest, including trapped air and gas in non-communicating airways, making it more accurate in severe obstruction compared to gas dilution methods which only measure communicating volumes.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Gas dilution methods (Helium dilution, Nitrogen washout) underestimate FRC in obstructive diseases due to trapped gas in poorly communicating lung units.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Helium dilution is a common method, but it's not the *gold standard* for patients with severe obstruction because it underestimates FRC in such cases.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "lung_volumes",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "In fixed large airway obstruction, the obstruction is constant regardless of transpulmonary pressure changes during inspiration or expiration. This results in proportional reduction and flattening of both the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the flow-volume loop.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Fixed obstruction examples include tracheal stenosis, goiter, or a foreign body. Variable extrathoracic obstruction causes inspiratory flattening, while variable intrathoracic obstruction causes expiratory flattening.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lung_volumes",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "In obstructive diseases, air trapping occurs due to premature airway closure and loss of elastic recoil. This leads to an increased residual volume (RV), which is the air remaining after maximal exhalation, and often an increased total lung capacity (TLC).",
    "highYieldPearl": "Increased RV is a hallmark of air trapping and hyperinflation in obstructive lung diseases, reflecting the inability to fully empty the lungs.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "While TLC can also be increased, RV is a more direct indicator of air trapping and is always increased in significant obstructive disease. Vital Capacity (VC) is often decreased.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "lung_volumes",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "In restrictive diseases, lung volumes are reduced proportionally. The flow-volume loop maintains its characteristic shape but is scaled down, appearing 'tall and narrow' due to reduced Total Lung Capacity (TLC) and Vital Capacity (VC), but often with preserved or even increased flow rates relative to lung volume.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Reduced TLC is the defining characteristic of restrictive lung disease, leading to a smaller, but often proportionally shaped, flow-volume loop.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",

      "C": "It relies on Boyle's Law",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "lung_volumes",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The nitrogen washout method involves breathing 100% oxygen to wash out nitrogen from the lungs. It measures only the gas in communicating airways. In severe obstruction, trapped gas in non-communicating areas is not measured, leading to an underestimation of FRC.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Gas dilution methods (Helium dilution, Nitrogen washout) are less accurate than body plethysmography in severe obstructive lung disease due to the presence of trapped air.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "lung_volumes",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "During forced expiration, after the initial peak flow, the flow becomes effort-independent. This segment is determined by the dynamic compression of airways (due to intrathoracic pressure) and the elastic recoil of the lung, which drives the airflow against airway resistance.",
    "highYieldPearl": "The shape of the effort-independent portion (e.g., FEF25-75%) is crucial for detecting small airway disease, as it reflects the intrinsic properties of the lung and airways.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "lung_volumes",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Increased airway resistance, as seen in obstructive diseases, leads to difficulty in exhaling air. This results in reduced expiratory flow rates, a characteristic 'scalloped' or concave appearance of the expiratory limb, and often an increased residual volume/total lung capacity.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Concavity of the expiratory limb is a classic spirometric sign of obstructive lung disease, reflecting dynamic airway collapse and increased resistance.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "lung_volumes",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "FEF25-75% (Forced Expiratory Flow between 25% and 75% of FVC) measures flow rates during the middle portion of forced expiration, which is largely effort-independent and reflects the patency of the small airways. It is often abnormal even when FEV1 is still relatively preserved.",
    "highYieldPearl": "FEF25-75% is often the first parameter to show abnormality in early obstructive diseases affecting the small airways, before larger airway involvement significantly reduces FEV1.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
