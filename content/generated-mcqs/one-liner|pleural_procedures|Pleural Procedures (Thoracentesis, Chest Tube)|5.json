      "A": "INR of 2.5",
      "B": "Platelet count of 40,000/µL",
      "C": "Uncooperative patient",
      "D": "Small, loculated effusion"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "pleural_procedures",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "While coagulopathy (INR >1.5-2, platelets <50,000) and small/loculated effusions are relative contraindications requiring careful consideration, correction of coagulopathy, or image guidance, an uncooperative patient poses a significant risk for procedural complications like lung laceration or pneumothorax and is often considered an absolute contraindication, especially for urgent therapeutic procedures where patient cooperation is crucial for safety.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Absolute contraindications for thoracentesis are rare but include an uncooperative patient and skin infection at the insertion site. Coagulopathy and small effusions are relative contraindications.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "The trap lies in identifying the *absolute* contraindication among commonly cited relative contraindications. Coagulopathy is a frequent distractor, but often can be corrected or managed with imaging guidance. Patient cooperation is paramount for safe execution of the procedure.",

    "question": "The most frequently encountered complication following thoracentesis is?",

      "C": "Re-expansion pulmonary edema",
      "D": "Infection"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "pleural_procedures",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Pneumothorax is the most common complication of thoracentesis, with rates varying depending on operator experience and use of ultrasound guidance (typically 2-10%). It usually occurs due to lung puncture. Other complications like hemothorax, re-expansion pulmonary edema, and infection are less common.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Always consider pneumothorax post-thoracentesis; a chest X-ray is often performed to rule it out, especially if symptoms arise.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "All options are known complications of thoracentesis, but the question specifically asks for the *most frequently encountered*. Students might be tempted by re-expansion pulmonary edema due to its severity, but it's less common than pneumothorax.",

    "question": "Optimal chest tube removal criteria for a resolving pneumothorax include air leak cessation and lung re-expansion, confirmed by?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Daily Chest X-ray",
      "B": "CT Thorax",
      "C": "Water seal trial for 24 hours",
      "D": "Direct visualization during thoracoscopy"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "pleural_procedures",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "For a pneumothorax, chest tube removal is typically considered when the air leak has ceased (often demonstrated by placing the chest tube to water seal for 12-24 hours without recurrence of bubbling) and the lung is fully re-expanded on chest X-ray. A water seal trial confirms the absence of a persistent air leak under physiological conditions before removal.",
    "highYieldPearl": "A successful water seal trial is critical before chest tube removal for pneumothorax, confirming no ongoing air leak and allowing lung expansion.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "While daily chest X-rays confirm lung re-expansion, they do not definitively confirm the absence of an air leak under normal physiological conditions. A water seal trial is specifically designed to assess for air leak cessation prior to removal.",

    "question": "What is the gold standard for immediate confirmation of a correctly placed pleural chest tube?",

      "C": "CT Thorax",
      "D": "Ultrasound"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "pleural_procedures",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Immediately following chest tube insertion, a post-procedure chest X-ray is the standard and most widely accepted method to confirm proper placement within the pleural space, assess lung re-expansion, and rule out complications like pneumothorax or misplacement. While auscultation and ultrasound can provide clues, they are not definitive. CT Thorax offers more detail but is not the immediate, routine confirmation method.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Always obtain a post-procedure chest X-ray after chest tube insertion to confirm placement and check for complications.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Students might consider CT Thorax as 'more accurate,' but the question asks for the *immediate* gold standard, which is a readily available and sufficient chest X-ray. Auscultation is unreliable for definitive placement confirmation.",

    "question": "The initial management strategy for a persistent air leak after chest tube insertion often includes?",

      "C": "Switching to a Heimlich valve",
      "D": "Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "pleural_procedures",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "A persistent air leak often indicates ongoing communication between the lung and the pleural space. The initial steps typically involve optimizing the chest tube system, which includes ensuring proper tube position, checking for leaks in the tubing system, and often increasing the level of suction (e.g., from -20 cm H2O to -30 cm H2O) to promote lung re-expansion and seal the leak. More invasive options like pleurodesis or surgical intervention are considered if conservative measures fail.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Before considering advanced interventions for a persistent air leak, ensure chest tube patency, correct placement, and optimize suction settings.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "The trap is to jump to more invasive or definitive treatments (pleurodesis, Heimlich valve) without considering the initial, less invasive optimization steps. Antibiotics are irrelevant unless infection is suspected.",
