    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "drug_induced_lung",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) can manifest in various ways, but chronic interstitial pneumonitis/fibrosis, often with an organizing pneumonia component, is the most common and characteristic. Histologically, it often shows interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and foamy macrophages (containing phospholipid inclusions).",
    "highYieldPearl": "Amiodarone toxicity is dose and duration-dependent, but can occur at any dose. Foamy macrophages are a key histological clue.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Distractors represent other types of lung injury, some drug-induced, but not characteristic of amiodarone. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is seen with drugs like minocycline, daptomycin. Bronchiolitis obliterans with penicillamine, gold. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is rare and not typically drug-induced.",

      "A": "Prior radiation therapy",
      "B": "Cumulative lifetime dose",
      "C": "Age over 70 years",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "drug_induced_lung",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Bleomycin-induced lung injury (BILI) is a severe, potentially fatal complication. The risk is strongly correlated with the cumulative lifetime dose, typically exceeding 200-300 mg. Other significant risk factors include advanced age, pre-existing lung disease, prior or concurrent radiation to the chest, and high inspired oxygen concentrations.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Cumulative dose is paramount for bleomycin-induced lung injury. Avoid high FiO2 in patients with prior bleomycin exposure.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "All options are potential risk factors for pulmonary fibrosis or lung injury in general. However, for bleomycin, the cumulative dose is the most consistently and strongly correlated factor. Prior radiation is also a significant risk, but cumulative dose is specific to bleomycin itself.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "drug_induced_lung",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Methotrexate-induced pneumonitis is an acute, often severe, hypersensitivity-mediated reaction. Histologically, it frequently presents with features of organizing pneumonia (BOOP/COP-like pattern), interstitial inflammation, and often eosinophilic infiltration. Granulomas can also be seen.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Methotrexate pneumonitis is a hypersensitivity reaction, not direct toxicity, and can occur at any dose, even low doses for rheumatologic conditions.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is characteristic of ARDS. Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) are distinct patterns. Organizing pneumonia is highly characteristic for methotrexate pneumonitis.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "drug_induced_lung",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Nitrofurantoin can cause acute or chronic lung injury. Acute reactions (occurring within days to weeks of initiation) are typically hypersensitivity-mediated, often presenting with fever, cough, dyspnea, and peripheral eosinophilia. Chronic reactions (occurring after months to years) are more often fibrotic.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Acute nitrofurantoin reaction = hypersensitivity (often with eosinophilia). Chronic nitrofurantoin reaction = fibrosis.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Oxidative stress is relevant for some drug toxicities (e.g., paraquat), but not the primary mechanism for acute nitrofurantoin. Direct cytotoxicity is a less specific mechanism. Immune checkpoint activation is specific to immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

The most common radiological patterns include organizing pneumonia (COP-like), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP-like), and hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like. COP is frequently observed radiologically, characterized by peribronchovascular consolidations or ground-glass opacities.",
    "highYieldPearl": "ICI pneumonitis can mimic various interstitial lung diseases; prompt recognition and steroid initiation are crucial for management.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Typical usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is characteristic of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Lymphangitic carcinomatosis describes a malignant infiltration pattern. Ground-glass opacities with honeycombing typically suggest fibrotic changes, which can be seen in chronic forms or severe DAD, but COP is a very common initial presentation pattern.",
