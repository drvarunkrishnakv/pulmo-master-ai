    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "sleep_physiology",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The Ventrolateral Preoptic Area (VLPO) of the hypothalamus is a key sleep-promoting center. It contains GABAergic and galaninergic neurons that inhibit wake-promoting nuclei, including the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), locus coeruleus (LC), dorsal and median raphe nuclei, and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), thereby initiating and maintaining NREM sleep.",
    "highYieldPearl": "VLPO is the 'sleep switch' for NREM sleep.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "The SCN regulates circadian rhythm, not direct sleep initiation. The LHA promotes wakefulness. Mammillary bodies are involved in memory formation and recall, not primary sleep initiation.",

    "question": "Which neurotransmitter system is primarily responsible for muscle atonia during REM sleep?",

      "A": "Cholinergic",
      "B": "Noradrenergic",
      "C": "Glycinergic",
      "D": "Dopaminergic"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "sleep_physiology",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "During REM sleep, muscle atonia is mediated by active inhibition of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. This inhibition is primarily achieved through the release of glycine and GABA from interneurons, leading to hyperpolarization of motor neurons and suppression of muscle activity. While cholinergic neurons are crucial for REM sleep generation and PGO waves, they do not directly cause atonia.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Glycine and GABA are key for REM sleep atonia.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Cholinergic activity is high in REM and crucial for its generation, but glycine/GABA directly cause atonia. Noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems are generally less active during REM and are associated with wakefulness/arousal.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "sleep_physiology",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "NREM Stage 3 (N3), also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS), is characterized by the presence of high-amplitude, low-frequency delta waves (0.5-2 Hz). For N3 sleep, delta waves must comprise 20% or more of the epoch. This is a key diagnostic criterion in polysomnography.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option A describes NREM Stage 2. Option C describes relaxed wakefulness. Option D (sawtooth waves) are characteristic of REM sleep. The percentage threshold for delta waves is critical for N3 definition.",

      "C": "Circadian rhythmicity",
      "D": "Muscle atonia"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "sleep_physiology",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), located in the anterior hypothalamus, is the master circadian pacemaker in mammals. It receives direct light input from the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract and synchronizes endogenous biological rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle, with the external light-dark cycle.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "REM sleep generation involves brainstem nuclei. Sleep-wake homeostasis is regulated by the accumulation of sleep drive (e.g., adenosine). Muscle atonia is a feature of REM sleep, mediated by brainstem/spinal cord mechanisms, not the SCN.",

    "question": "Which thermoregulatory change is characteristic of REM sleep?",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "sleep_physiology",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "During REM sleep, the body's thermoregulatory mechanisms are effectively suspended. This leads to a state of 'poikilothermy' or 'cold-bloodedness,' where the body loses its ability to maintain a stable core temperature through shivering, sweating, or vasoconstriction/dilation in response to environmental changes. This is distinct from NREM sleep where thermoregulation is actively maintained.",
    "highYieldPearl": "REM sleep is characterized by poikilothermy (loss of thermoregulation).",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "trapAnalysis": "While shivering and sweating thresholds are indeed altered during REM sleep (e.g., suppressed heat loss responses), the overarching characteristic is the complete failure of thermoregulation, leading to poikilothermy. Stable core body temperature is generally maintained during NREM sleep.",
