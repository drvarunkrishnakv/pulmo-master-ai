The provided LUS findings show that an 'N-pattern' (normal aeration) was maintained down to a PEEP of 16 cmH2O, with corresponding good oxygenation (PaO2+PaCO2 = 399.8 mmHg). However, when PEEP was further reduced to 14 cmH2O, the LUS pattern changed to a 'B1-pattern', indicating the onset of alveolar derecruitment and loss of aeration. Concurrently, there was a noticeable drop in oxygenation (PaO2+PaCO2 decreased to 352.2 mmHg). Therefore, setting the PEEP at 16 cmH2O would be the most appropriate choice, as it is the lowest PEEP that effectively maintains alveolar recruitment (N-pattern) as identified by lung ultrasound, thereby preventing atelectrauma, without unnecessarily high pressures that could lead to overdistension or hemodynamic instability. This approach aligns with the principle of reducing atelectrauma and increasing alveolar recruitment with higher PEEP, while indirectly minimizing volutrauma by preventing cyclical collapse and reopening.",

      "C": "While 20 cmH2O maintains an N-pattern, it is higher than 16 cmH2O, which also effectively maintains recruitment. Using unnecessarily high PEEP increases the risk of overdistension (volutrauma) and potential for decreased cardiac output, without providing additional recruitment benefits compared to 16 cmH2O. The goal is the lowest effective PEEP.",
      "D": "This PEEP level (24 cmH2O, implicitly from the initial post-RM N-pattern) is even higher than 20 cmH2O. Although it maintains an N-pattern, it carries the highest risk of overdistension and hemodynamic compromise among the options that maintain recruitment. It does not offer additional recruitment benefit compared to 16 cmH2O, making it suboptimal due to increased risk."
