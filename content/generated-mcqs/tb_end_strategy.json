EGPA is characterized by a classic triad of asthma, hypereosinophilia, and necrotizing vasculitis. Option A is incorrect because, in contrast to GPA and MPA, pulmonary hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis are much less common in EGPA. Option B is incorrect as EGPA typically involves the upper airway (rhinitis, sinusitis) but generally without the destructive features (e.g., saddle nose deformity, laryngeal stenosis) associated with Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA).

While ANCA serology is supportive, the definitive diagnosis of EGPA requires histopathological confirmation of necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis and eosinophil-rich inflammation, often with granulomatous features. Therefore, a biopsy of an involved organ, such as the lung, is the most appropriate next diagnostic step to confirm the diagnosis. Option A is less appropriate as glomerulonephritis is less common in EGPA compared to other ANCA-associated vasculitides, and there is no mention of renal dysfunction in the vignette. Option B and D would be relevant for ruling out allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPA), which can mimic some features of EGPA (asthma, eosinophilia, lung opacities), but the presence of p-ANCA and systemic vasculitic features like pericarditis make EGPA much more likely, necessitating a vasculitis-specific diagnostic approach.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rio's Take: While clinical and serological findings are highly suggestive for EGPA, tissue biopsy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, revealing the characteristic necrotizing vasculitis and eosinophilic inflammation.

      "B": "BAL for fungal culture (and eosinophil count) is relevant for eosinophilic lung diseases like ABPA, which shares asthma and eosinophilia. However, the positive p-ANCA and cardiac involvement point away from ABPA as the primary diagnosis, making a definitive vasculitis biopsy more urgent.",
