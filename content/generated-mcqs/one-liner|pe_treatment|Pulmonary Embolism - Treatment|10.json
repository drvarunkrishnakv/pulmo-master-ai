    "topic": "pe_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "For a first episode of pulmonary embolism provoked by a transient and reversible risk factor (e.g., surgery, trauma, estrogen therapy), the recommended minimum duration of anticoagulation is 3 months.

    "topic": "pe_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "For a first unprovoked pulmonary embolism, indefinite anticoagulation is generally recommended after the initial 3-6 month period, as the risk of recurrence is higher compared to provoked PE.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "pe_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) is the preferred anticoagulant for treating acute PE during pregnancy. Unlike warfarin, it does not cross the placenta, thus avoiding teratogenic effects. UFH is also safe but requires more frequent monitoring and has a higher risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). DOACs are generally contraindicated due to lack of safety data in pregnancy.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
