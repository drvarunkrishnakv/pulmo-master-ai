CEP, while involving eosinophilic inflammation of the lung parenchyma, does not involve systemic vasculitis.

Group 3 PH is typically due to significant parenchymal lung disease or hypoxia, and while PVR > 5WU is a severe phenotype, the etiology in SSc without significant ILD is primarily vascular remodeling characteristic of PAH.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "copd_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "A chest X-ray is often performed in the initial workup of suspected COPD, not to diagnose COPD itself (as it's often normal or shows non-specific changes), but primarily to exclude other conditions that can mimic COPD symptoms, such as congestive heart failure, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. High-resolution CT (HRCT) is superior for confirming emphysema.",
    "highYieldPearl": "CXR in COPD is for differential diagnosis, not primary diagnosis or severity assessment.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "A common trap is to overestimate the diagnostic power of a chest X-ray for COPD or emphysema, when HRCT is more definitive for parenchymal changes and spirometry for airflow obstruction.",
