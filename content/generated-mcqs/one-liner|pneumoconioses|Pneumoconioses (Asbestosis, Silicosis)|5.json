    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "pneumoconioses",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Pleural plaques are the most common radiographic manifestation of asbestos exposure, often asymptomatic and benign. They are typically bilateral, discrete, and appear on the parietal pleura, diaphragm, and mediastinum. Calcification is common. While asbestosis itself causes interstitial fibrosis (honeycombing), plaques are highly specific to asbestos exposure.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Pleural plaques are highly specific for asbestos exposure but do not directly reflect asbestosis severity or predict malignant transformation.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Honeycombing is seen in fibrotic asbestosis but is non-specific and also seen in other interstitial lung diseases. Eggshell calcifications are characteristic of silicosis.",

      "C": "Fibroblast",
      "D": "Neutrophil"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "pneumoconioses",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Alveolar macrophages phagocytose inhaled silica particles. Unable to effectively clear them, the macrophages become activated, release reactive oxygen species, and undergo apoptosis or necrosis, which in turn releases pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and fibrogenic mediators (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1, PDGF, TGF-β). This cascade then activates fibroblasts, leading to collagen deposition and progressive fibrosis.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Macrophage activation and subsequent release of fibrogenic mediators are central to silicosis pathogenesis.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Fibroblasts are the effector cells responsible for collagen production and fibrosis, but they are activated by signals from the macrophages, which initiate the pathological process.",

      "D": "Small cell carcinoma"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "pneumoconioses",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Malignant mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer of the pleura, peritoneum, or pericardium, almost exclusively linked to asbestos exposure. It has a characteristic long latency period (20-50 years) after initial exposure. While asbestos also increases the risk of lung cancer (all histological types), especially with concomitant smoking, mesothelioma has the strongest and most specific association with asbestos.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Malignant mesothelioma is the signature malignancy of asbestos exposure.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Lung cancer risk (including adenocarcinoma) is increased by asbestos, but mesothelioma's link is far more specific and dose-dependent, making it the most characteristic asbestos-related malignancy.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "pneumoconioses",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Eggshell calcification refers to calcified lymph nodes with a peripheral rim of calcification and a lucent center. It is highly characteristic, though not pathognomonic, of silicosis, particularly affecting the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. It typically indicates chronic and often severe silica exposure.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Eggshell calcification of hilar lymph nodes is a hallmark radiographic sign of silicosis.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Diffuse enlargement is non-specific. Central necrosis can be seen in other granulomatous diseases like tuberculosis. Peripheral rim enhancement is often seen with abscesses or necrotic tumors post-contrast.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "pneumoconioses",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Currently, there is no specific curative treatment for established pneumoconioses. Management focuses on preventing further exposure, symptomatic relief (e.g., bronchodilators for airflow limitation, oxygen therapy for hypoxemia), managing complications (e.g., recurrent infections, cor pulmonale), and pulmonary rehabilitation. While lung transplantation is an option for severe, end-stage disease, it is not considered the primary or definitive treatment for the disease process itself. Anti-fibrotic drugs are under investigation but not standard definitive therapy.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Prevention of exposure is paramount, and treatment for established pneumoconioses is primarily supportive.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Anti-fibrotic drugs (like pirfenidone/nintedanib) are used for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), and their role in pneumoconioses is not yet established as definitive. Lung transplantation is a last-resort for end-stage disease, not a general treatment.",
