      "C": "Elevated serum IgM",
      "D": "Elevated serum C-reactive protein"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "abpa",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Elevated total IgE is a cornerstone of ABPA diagnosis. ISHAM criteria include total IgE > 1000 IU/mL (or > 500 IU/mL if other criteria are strongly met). It reflects the allergic inflammatory response to Aspergillus antigens.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Total IgE is not only diagnostic but also crucial for monitoring disease activity and treatment response in ABPA.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Other options are not primary serological diagnostic criteria for ABPA. Peripheral eosinophilia is a hematological finding, not strictly serological, and while common, not as specific or universally elevated as total IgE in all stages.",

      "C": "Type III and Type IV",
      "D": "Type I and Type III"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "abpa",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "ABPA is characterized by an exaggerated immune response to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens. Type I (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity leads to bronchospasm and eosinophilic inflammation. Type III (immune complex-mediated) hypersensitivity contributes to immune complex deposition in the airways, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.",
    "highYieldPearl": "The combination of Type I and Type III hypersensitivity reactions explains the characteristic IgE elevation, eosinophilia, and immune complex-mediated inflammation leading to bronchiectasis in ABPA.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Confusing the types of hypersensitivity is common. Type II is cytotoxic and Type IV is delayed-type; neither are primary mechanisms in ABPA.",

      "C": "High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "abpa",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "HRCT provides detailed imaging of the lung parenchyma and airways, allowing for precise identification of central bronchiectasis, which is a hallmark feature of ABPA. Chest X-ray is often insensitive for early or mild bronchiectasis.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Central bronchiectasis is a major diagnostic criterion for ABPA (especially by Rosenberg-Patterson criteria), and HRCT is the definitive tool to identify it.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Chest X-ray is too insensitive. Bronchoscopy is invasive and not primarily for anatomical diagnosis of bronchiectasis. MRI has limited utility for lung parenchyma compared to HRCT.",

      "C": "Oral corticosteroids",
      "D": "Omalizumab"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "abpa",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) are the cornerstone of treatment for acute exacerbations of ABPA, rapidly suppressing the inflammatory response and preventing progressive lung damage. Antifungals like itraconazole are often added for their steroid-sparing effect and to reduce fungal burden, but steroids are primary for acute inflammation.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Systemic corticosteroids are the primary anti-inflammatory agents in ABPA; antifungals are adjunctive, mainly for steroid-sparing or recalcitrant cases, not first-line for acute exacerbations.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Itraconazole is important but not first-line for acute exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids are less effective for systemic inflammation. Omalizumab is a biologic for severe, refractory cases, not initial first-line.",

    "question": "Which marker is primarily used to monitor ABPA treatment response and disease activity?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Peripheral eosinophil count",
      "B": "Serum Aspergillus-specific IgG",
      "C": "Serum total IgE levels",
      "D": "FEV1 on spirometry"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "abpa",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Serum total IgE levels correlate well with disease activity in ABPA. A significant drop (e.g., >25-35%) in total IgE after corticosteroid therapy indicates a good response. Rising IgE levels can signal a relapse or exacerbation.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Total IgE is the most practical and widely accepted biomarker for monitoring ABPA disease activity and response to therapy.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Peripheral eosinophil count can be used but is less specific and can be influenced by other factors. Aspergillus-specific IgG levels are generally less dynamic than total IgE for monitoring. FEV1 measures lung function but doesn't directly reflect the inflammatory activity as well as IgE.",
