    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "ards_ventilation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The ARDSNet trial demonstrated a significant mortality benefit with a tidal volume target of 6 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW), allowing a range of 4-8 ml/kg PBW to maintain plateau pressure below 30 cmH2O. This strategy minimizes volutrauma and barotrauma.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "ards_ventilation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "A plateau pressure (Pplat) exceeding 30 cmH2O is strongly associated with increased ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) due to overdistension of aerated lung regions. Pplat reflects the static pressure in the alveoli at the end of inspiration.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Plateau pressure is measured during an inspiratory hold and reflects alveolar distending pressure.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "ards_ventilation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Driving pressure (ΔP) is the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP (Pplat - PEEP). It represents the tidal stretch or distending pressure applied to the functional lung. Studies have shown it to be a strong predictor of mortality, independent of tidal volume and PEEP.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Aim to keep driving pressure below 15 cmH2O, ideally less than 13 cmH2O, as it correlates with mortality.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Confusing driving pressure with peak pressure, mean airway pressure, or transpulmonary pressure are common pitfalls. Driving pressure specifically reflects the cyclic change in lung volume.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "ards_ventilation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Permissive hypercapnia refers to the strategy of tolerating elevated PaCO2 (leading to respiratory acidosis) as a consequence of using lower tidal volumes to prevent VILI. The pH should generally be maintained above 7.20-7.25 by adjusting bicarbonate if necessary.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Lower tidal volumes reduce CO2 clearance, necessitating permissive hypercapnia to protect the lungs.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Hypoxemia is managed, not intentionally tolerated. Respiratory alkalosis would be the opposite of permissive hypercapnia, and metabolic acidosis is a separate issue.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "ards_ventilation",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "ards_ventilation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Prone positioning improves oxygenation by homogenizing the distribution of pleural pressure, which reduces compression atelectasis in dependent lung regions, shifts perfusion to better-ventilated areas, and decreases ventilator-induced lung injury by reducing stress and strain heterogeneity.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "ards_ventilation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) are used to eliminate patient-ventilator asynchrony, reduce oxygen consumption, and ensure strict adherence to lung-protective ventilation parameters (e.g., low tidal volume, optimal PEEP) by preventing spontaneous breathing efforts that can worsen VILI. The ACURASYS trial supported its use in severe ARDS.",

Reducing VILI leads to improved patient outcomes.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "ards_ventilation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Lung size is primarily determined by height and sex, not actual body weight. Therefore, predicted body weight (PBW), calculated using height and sex, is used to determine appropriate tidal volumes. This prevents overdistension in obese patients whose actual body weight is disproportionately higher than their lung capacity.",
    "highYieldPearl": "PBW formula: 50 + 0.91 (height in cm - 152.4) for males; 45.5 + 0.91 (height in cm - 152.4) for females.",
