    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "osa_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the most effective and widely accepted first-line treatment for moderate to severe OSA. It delivers pressurized air through a mask, creating a pneumatic splint that prevents upper airway collapse during sleep.",
    "highYieldPearl": "CPAP improves AHI, oxygenation, sleep architecture, and reduces daytime sleepiness and cardiovascular risk.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Oral appliances are for mild-moderate OSA or CPAP intolerance. Surgeries are typically second-line. Positional therapy is for specific positional OSA.",

    "question": "The primary mechanism of action for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in OSA is?",

      "A": "Stimulating respiratory drive",
      "B": "Reducing pharyngeal edema",
      "C": "Pneumatic splinting of the upper airway",
      "D": "Increasing oxygen saturation directly"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "osa_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "CPAP acts as a pneumatic splint, delivering positive pressure to the upper airway. This pressure keeps the pharyngeal airway open, preventing its collapse during inspiration and expiration, thus eliminating apneas and hypopneas.",
    "highYieldPearl": "CPAP maintains airway patency by counteracting the negative inspiratory pressure and intrinsic collapsibility of the pharynx.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "CPAP does not directly stimulate respiratory drive or reduce edema as its primary action, nor does it directly increase oxygen saturation (it does so indirectly by restoring airflow).",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "osa_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) work by physically advancing the mandible (lower jaw) and tongue forward. This increases the retrolingual and retropalatal airspace, preventing tongue base collapse and soft palate vibration.",
    "highYieldPearl": "MADs are generally effective for mild-to-moderate OSA, especially in patients who cannot tolerate CPAP.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "MADs do not directly stimulate muscles or primarily increase nasal airflow; their effect is anatomical repositioning.",

      "D": "Tracheostomy"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "osa_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Tracheostomy involves creating a surgical opening in the trachea to bypass the entire upper airway. This completely eliminates the possibility of upper airway obstruction during sleep, making it the most definitive surgical solution for severe, refractory OSA, though rarely performed due to invasiveness.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Tracheostomy is reserved for life-threatening OSA or when all other treatments have failed.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "UPPP, genioglossus advancement, and MMA aim to widen specific parts of the upper airway, but do not bypass it entirely.",

    "highYieldPearl": "Modafinil is not a primary treatment for OSA; it addresses a symptom after primary treatment.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "osa_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) is a highly effective surgical procedure that involves moving both the maxilla and mandible forward. It is particularly indicated for patients with significant craniofacial abnormalities like retrognathia or midface hypoplasia, where the airway is anatomically constrained.",
    "highYieldPearl": "MMA offers one of the highest success rates among OSA surgeries, especially for anatomically predisposed patients.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "trapAnalysis": "MMA is a major surgery not for mild OSA or isolated tonsillar hypertrophy (which might benefit from UPPP). CPAP intolerance due to claustrophobia would lead to other non-surgical or less invasive surgical options first.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "osa_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Hypoglossal nerve stimulation involves implanting a device that stimulates the hypoglossal nerve, which innervates the genioglossus muscle. This stimulation causes the tongue to protrude during inspiration, preventing its collapse into the posterior pharynx.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "trapAnalysis": "The diaphragm and intercostals are primary muscles of respiration, but not directly targeted by hypoglossal nerve stimulation for OSA. Sternocleidomastoid is a neck muscle, not directly involved in tongue movement for airway patency.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "osa_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Positional OSA is a subtype where the severity of sleep apnea (AHI) is at least twice as high when sleeping in the supine position compared to non-supine positions. Positional therapy aims to prevent supine sleeping using devices like positional alarms or special pillows.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "osa_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "UPPP is a surgical procedure that involves removing excess tissue from the soft palate, uvula, tonsils, and sometimes part of the pharyngeal wall. This aims to widen the oropharynx, reducing obstruction at this level.",
    "highYieldPearl": "UPPP has variable success rates and is often considered for patients with significant soft palate/tonsillar hypertrophy, typically after CPAP failure.",

      "C": "Weight loss",
      "D": "Regular exercise"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "osa_treatment",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Weight loss, particularly in overweight and obese individuals, is a crucial non-surgical intervention for OSA. Even a modest weight loss (e.g., 10-15%) can significantly reduce AHI by decreasing fat deposits around the pharynx, thereby increasing airway lumen size and reducing collapsibility.",
    "highYieldPearl": "While not always curative alone, weight loss is a fundamental adjunctive therapy that can improve the efficacy of other treatments like CPAP.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "While smoking cessation, alcohol avoidance, and regular exercise are beneficial for overall health and can impact OSA, weight loss has the most direct and significant impact on airway anatomy and AHI reduction.",
