    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "ph_group3",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Group 3 PH is due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia. The main mechanism is sustained hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), where chronic hypoxia leads to chronic vasoconstriction and subsequent vascular remodeling. This increases pulmonary vascular resistance and mean pulmonary arterial pressure. This mechanism distinguishes it from Group 1 PAH (endothelial dysfunction, proliferation) and Group 2 PH (elevated left-sided pressures).",
    "highYieldPearl": "Hypoxia is the cornerstone and primary driver of pulmonary hypertension in Group 3.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Candidates might confuse the general mechanisms of PH. Endothelial dysfunction is primary in Group 1 PAH. Increased pulmonary blood flow is seen in congenital heart diseases. Left ventricular dysfunction causes Group 2 PH.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "ph_group3",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Group 3 PH encompasses pulmonary hypertension due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia. This includes conditions like COPD, ILD, OSA, hypoventilation syndromes, and chronic exposure to high altitude. CTEPH (Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension) is classified as Group 4 Pulmonary Hypertension according to the WHO classification.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "ph_group3",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "For Group 3 PH, the primary treatment strategy is to address the underlying lung disease and correct hypoxia. Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is the cornerstone, as it directly counteracts the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which is the main driver of PH in this group. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-specific therapies (e.g., PDE5 inhibitors, ERAs, prostanoids) are generally not recommended as monotherapy for Group 3 PH due to limited evidence of benefit and potential for harm (e.g., worsening V/Q mismatch, increased mortality).",
    "highYieldPearl": "Oxygen therapy is the most effective and recommended treatment for Group 3 PH, targeting the root cause of hypoxia.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "The trap is to assume that all forms of pulmonary hypertension are treated with PAH-specific drugs. For Group 3, addressing the underlying lung disease and hypoxia is paramount, making oxygen therapy the key.",

    "question": "In Group 3 PH, which hemodynamic parameter most directly reflects increased pulmonary vascular afterload due to vascular remodeling?",

      "A": "Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP)",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "ph_group3",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "While mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) is elevated in all forms of PH, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is the most direct measure of the resistance to blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature. In Group 3 PH, chronic hypoxia and inflammation lead to structural remodeling (thickening, fibrosis) and functional changes (vasoconstriction) of the pulmonary arteries, which directly increases PVR. PAWP is typically normal in Group 3 PH, differentiating it from Group 2 PH (left heart disease). Cardiac output can vary.",
    "highYieldPearl": "PVR is the gold standard for quantifying the degree of pulmonary vascular bed obstruction and remodeling in PH, particularly relevant in Group 3.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "trapAnalysis": "mPAP is elevated in all PH. PAWP is a trap as it's normal in Group 3. Cardiac output is a component of the PVR calculation but not a direct measure of afterload itself. PVR directly quantifies the resistance to flow.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "ph_group3",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Cor pulmonale is defined as right ventricular enlargement (hypertrophy, dilation) due to pulmonary hypertension caused by primary disorders of the lung, chest wall, or pulmonary circulation (excluding left heart disease). Chronic hypoxemia and the resulting pulmonary hypertension in Group 3 lead to increased afterload on the right ventricle, eventually causing right ventricular dysfunction and failure, which is termed cor pulmonale.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Cor pulmonale is the hallmark cardiac complication of chronic lung disease and Group 3 PH, reflecting chronic right ventricular strain.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is typically associated with systemic hypertension or aortic stenosis. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a broader term for myocardial dysfunction. Pericardial effusion is a non-specific finding that can occur in various conditions.",
