    "deepDiveExplanation": "CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) has largely replaced conventional pulmonary angiography as the definitive gold standard due to its non-invasiveness, speed, wide availability, and high sensitivity and specificity for acute PE, even for segmental and subsegmental emboli. It is the first-line imaging for hemodynamically stable patients with suspected PE.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "pe_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "For hemodynamically unstable patients, Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) can rapidly identify signs of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction/strain, estimate pulmonary artery pressures, and exclude other causes of shock (e.g., tamponade, severe LV dysfunction). If TTE shows RV strain and no other cause of shock, empiric PE treatment can be initiated while definitive imaging (if feasible) is considered. CTPA is often too time-consuming or risky for an unstable patient.",

A normal D-dimer (below an age-adjusted threshold) can safely rule out PE in patients with a low or low-to-intermediate pre-test probability, as determined by clinical prediction rules (e.g., Wells' or revised Geneva score). It has a high negative predictive value. It should not be used to rule out PE in patients with a high clinical probability.",

In patients with an abnormal CXR or significant lung disease like COPD, V/Q scans are often non-diagnostic (intermediate probability). While severe renal impairment (D) is a reason to *choose* V/Q over CTPA, the *usefulness* and diagnostic yield of the V/Q scan itself are highest with a normal CXR.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "pe_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Acute PE typically causes a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, leading to hypoxemia. The hypoxemia stimulates peripheral chemoreceptors, increasing respiratory drive and causing hyperventilation, which results in a low PaCO2 (respiratory alkalosis). While some patients may have normal ABGs, respiratory alkalosis with hypoxemia is the most common and characteristic abnormality.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "pe_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "V/Q scanning is often preferred in pregnant patients because it delivers a lower radiation dose to the breasts (compared to CTPA), which is a significant concern during pregnancy due to the risk of radiation-induced breast cancer. While fetal radiation dose is comparable for both, breast dose often tips the balance towards V/Q, especially if the chest X-ray is normal. Gadolinium is generally avoided in pregnancy due to potential fetal risks.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "pe_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "In acute PE, increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular (RV) afterload lead to RV wall stress, ischemia, and dysfunction. This RV strain can cause the release of cardiac biomarkers like troponins (due to myocyte injury) and BNP (due to wall stretch). These biomarkers are crucial for risk stratification, indicating higher mortality risk and often guiding management decisions (e.g., thrombolysis consideration).",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "While troponins are primarily associated with MI, in the context of PE, their elevation signifies RV strain, not necessarily an MI. BNP is also associated with heart failure, but in PE, it's specific to RV stress rather than primary LV failure.",

However, it is highly indicated when there is high clinical suspicion for PE, but CTPA is contraindicated (e.g., severe renal failure, contrast allergy, pregnancy where V/Q is inconclusive or non-diagnostic). If a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is found by CUS in this scenario, treating the DVT is equivalent to treating PE, allowing therapeutic anticoagulation without needing further PE imaging. It can also be useful in unstable patients where CTPA is not feasible, and TTE shows RV strain.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option B (CTPA equivocal) is a plausible scenario, but finding a DVT doesn't directly diagnose PE; it identifies the source and allows for empiric treatment. Option C is stronger because finding a DVT allows for *treatment initiation* in situations where PE imaging is problematic, effectively managing the underlying condition without direct PE visualization.",
