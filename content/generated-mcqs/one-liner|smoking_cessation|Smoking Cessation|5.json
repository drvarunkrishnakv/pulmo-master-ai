      "C": "Clonidine",
      "D": "Gabapentin"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "smoking_cessation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Varenicline is a partial agonist at the alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, reducing withdrawal symptoms and blocking nicotine's reinforcing effects. Bupropion SR and Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) are also considered first-line pharmacotherapies.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Varenicline generally demonstrates the highest efficacy among single pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Nortriptyline and Clonidine are considered second-line agents. Gabapentin has no established role in smoking cessation.",

    "question": "Bupropion SR aids smoking cessation primarily by which mechanism?",

      "A": "Nicotinic receptor partial agonism",
      "B": "Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibition",
      "C": "GABAergic modulation",
      "D": "Serotonin reuptake inhibition"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "smoking_cessation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). Its antidepressant and smoking cessation effects are thought to be mediated by these actions, which help to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Bupropion is also used as an antidepressant and is contraindicated in seizure disorders.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option A describes the mechanism of Varenicline. Options C and D are not the primary mechanisms of action for Bupropion SR in smoking cessation.",

      "C": "History of seizures",
      "D": "Mild hypertension"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "smoking_cessation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold. Therefore, a history of seizures, eating disorders (e.g., bulimia or anorexia nervosa due to electrolyte imbalances increasing seizure risk), or abrupt alcohol/sedative withdrawal are absolute contraindications.",
    "highYieldPearl": "The risk of seizures with Bupropion is dose-dependent.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "COPD, stable angina, and mild hypertension are generally not contraindications for Bupropion SR; in fact, smoking cessation benefits these conditions.",

      "B": "Unstable angina",
      "C": "Serious arrhythmias",
      "D": "Controlled hypertension"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "smoking_cessation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "NRT is generally safer than continued smoking. While caution is advised, controlled hypertension is not an absolute contraindication. Conditions like recent MI, unstable angina, and serious arrhythmias are relative contraindications where NRT should be used with caution and under medical supervision, but the benefits of cessation generally outweigh the risks of NRT.",
    "highYieldPearl": "The risks associated with continued smoking far outweigh the risks of NRT in nearly all cardiovascular conditions.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "Options A, B, and C represent conditions where NRT use requires careful consideration and medical supervision, often considered relative contraindications due to increased cardiac risk, though the benefit of cessation often outweighs the NRT risk. Controlled hypertension is generally considered safe for NRT.",

      "C": "8 weeks",
      "D": "12 weeks"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "smoking_cessation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The standard recommended duration for both Varenicline and Bupropion SR is 12 weeks (3 months). Some guidelines suggest extending treatment for up to 6 months in individuals who respond well and wish to further reduce relapse risk.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Adherence to the full recommended course of pharmacotherapy significantly improves long-term smoking cessation success rates.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "Shorter durations (2, 4, or 8 weeks) are generally insufficient for optimal efficacy and sustained abstinence from smoking.",
