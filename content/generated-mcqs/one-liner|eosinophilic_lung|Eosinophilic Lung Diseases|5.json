      "C": "15%",
      "D": "25%"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "eosinophilic_lung",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia (AEP) is a rapidly progressive illness characterized by diffuse alveolar infiltrates and hypoxemia. A hallmark diagnostic feature is significant bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid eosinophilia, typically greater than 25%, often reaching 40-60% or higher. This distinguishes it from other forms of eosinophilic lung disease where BAL eosinophilia might be lower.",
    "highYieldPearl": "BAL eosinophilia >25% is highly suggestive of AEP, especially in acute onset respiratory failure unresponsive to conventional therapy.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "Lower percentages of BAL eosinophilia (e.g., 5-10%) can be seen in other conditions like asthma or even some interstitial lung diseases. The high threshold (>25%) is critical for AEP diagnosis.",

      "C": "Tuberculosis",
      "D": "Interstitial fibrosis"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "eosinophilic_lung",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Chronic Eosinophilic Pneumonia (CEP) characteristically presents with peripheral infiltrates on chest imaging, often involving the lung periphery, upper, and mid-lung zones, while sparing the perihilar regions. This distribution is considered the 'photographic negative' of pulmonary edema, which typically shows central, perihilar 'bat wing' infiltrates.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Peripheral infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT are a classic, high-yield imaging feature for CEP.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "While other conditions cause various radiographic patterns, the 'photographic negative of pulmonary edema' description is highly specific to CEP and should not be confused with other infiltrative processes.",

      "B": "Absence of central bronchiectasis",

      "D": "Normal total serum IgE"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "eosinophilic_lung",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The modified set of diagnostic criteria for ABPA typically includes predisposing conditions (e.g., asthma, cystic fibrosis) and several major and minor criteria. Major criteria include: asthma, immediate cutaneous reactivity to Aspergillus fumigatus, total serum IgE >1000 IU/mL, specific IgE and IgG to A. fumigatus, peripheral eosinophilia (>500 cells/µL), and central bronchiectasis. Positive Aspergillus precipitins (IgG to A. fumigatus) is also a major criterion.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Remember the key immunological markers (IgE, specific IgE/IgG to Aspergillus, precipitins) and imaging findings (central bronchiectasis) for ABPA diagnosis.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option A is incorrect as peripheral eosinophilia is a major criterion if >500 cells/µL. Option B is incorrect as central bronchiectasis is a major criterion. Option D is incorrect as elevated total serum IgE (>1000 IU/mL) is a major criterion.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "eosinophilic_lung",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly Churg-Strauss Syndrome, can be divided into ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative subsets. p-ANCA (MPO-ANCA) positivity in EGPA is typically associated with vasculitic manifestations, particularly glomerulonephritis (renal disease) and peripheral neuropathy. ANCA-negative EGPA often has more prominent eosinophilic features and tends to be associated with cardiac involvement and lung infiltrates.",
    "highYieldPearl": "p-ANCA (MPO-ANCA) positive EGPA = vasculitic features (renal, neuropathy). ANCA-negative EGPA = eosinophilic features (cardiac, pulmonary infiltrates).",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "trapAnalysis": "All options represent possible manifestations of EGPA. However, the question specifically asks about the association with p-ANCA positivity, which points towards vasculitic organ damage, notably renal involvement. Cardiac disease is more prevalent in ANCA-negative EGPA.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "Numerous drugs can induce eosinophilic lung disease, including antibiotics (e.g., nitrofurantoin, sulfonamides), NSAIDs, phenytoin, L-tryptophan, and others. Nitrofurantoin is a classic and frequently cited cause of acute or chronic drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia, characterized by peripheral eosinophilia and pulmonary infiltrates.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Always consider drug-induced etiology in a patient presenting with eosinophilic lung disease, with nitrofurantoin being a key culprit.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "While other drug classes can cause various lung toxicities (e.g., ACE inhibitors causing cough, amiodarone causing interstitial lung disease), nitrofurantoin is specifically associated with eosinophilic lung reactions. It's important to differentiate drug-induced lung injury types.",
