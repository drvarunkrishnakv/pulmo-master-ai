    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "Polysomnography Interpretation",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The provided text specifically highlights a limitation regarding oxygen desaturation interpretation: 'Oxygen desaturation may be associated with hypoventilation but, because oxygen desaturation can also be seen with obstructive and central respiratory events, it cannot be relied on alone in diagnosing sleep hypoventilation.' This means that while oxygen desaturations are observed, their isolated presence in a limited channel study (like Type 3, which lacks CO2 monitoring or full respiratory effort channels for specific hypoventilation diagnosis) does not definitively confirm sleep hypoventilation. The desaturation could be due to obstructive or central apneas as well. Therefore, making a reliable diagnosis of sleep hypoventilation based solely on oxygen desaturation from a Type 3 study is problematic.",

      "A": "Trap. While Type 3 studies indeed lack EEG, EOG, and EMG, making accurate sleep staging impossible, the question specifically asks about a critical limitation related to *interpreting oxygen desaturation alone*. This option describes a general limitation of Type 3 but not the specific one highlighted regarding O2 desaturation in the context.",
      "B": "Trap. Type 3 studies, with limited respiratory channels, can have difficulty differentiating between central and obstructive apneas due to insufficient detail in respiratory effort monitoring and lack of EEG for arousal detection. However, the provided text specifically addresses the limitation of O2 desaturation for *hypoventilation* rather than apnea differentiation.",
      "C": "Correct. The provided text directly states: 'Oxygen desaturation may be associated with hypoventilation but, because oxygen desaturation can also be seen with obstructive and central respiratory events, it cannot be relied on alone in diagnosing sleep hypoventilation.' This is the precise limitation highlighted.",
      "D": "Trap. Type 3 studies typically do not include specific EMG channels (e.g., tibialis anterior) required for the diagnosis of RLS-related periodic limb movements. However, this is a limitation regarding the assessment of a specific movement disorder, not a direct limitation regarding the interpretation of oxygen desaturation findings for sleep breathing disorders as specifically outlined in the context."
