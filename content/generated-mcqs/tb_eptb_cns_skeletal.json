The pathogenesis involves a complex interplay, and a critical component is the dysfunction of regulatory T cells (T-reg). These cells, normally responsible for suppressing cell-mediated immune responses, are often found to be defective or 'exhausted' in sarcoidosis patients. This defect in T-reg function allows for the unchecked proliferation and activation of Th1 cells and macrophages, perpetuating granuloma formation.

      "B": "Incorrect. Performing an invasive procedure like VATS for a 'definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis' is not the most appropriate *initial* step.

The initial and most crucial step is to withdraw the offending drug. Corticosteroids are often used to manage symptomatic DILI, especially when granulomas are present.",
      "D": "Incorrect. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated for bacterial infections. The chronic nature of the symptoms, presence of granulomas, and specific drug history (amiodarone) point away from an acute atypical pneumonia as the primary diagnosis.

The patient has confirmed Group 1 PAH, which is a life-threatening condition requiring PAH-specific therapies (e.g., endothelin receptor antagonists, PDE5 inhibitors, prostacyclin analogs).

Although ILD is present, it is considered mild, and the hemodynamics are not typical of PH driven predominantly by lung disease (Group 3), which often has a lower PVR and may not meet full Group 1 criteria. Inhaled Treprostinil is indicated for specific Group 3 PH patients, but the primary diagnosis here is Group 1."

    "deepDiveExplanation": "While rapid molecular tests like GeneXpert MTB/RIF offer high sensitivity and specificity for Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM), CSF culture on solid (e.g., Löwenstein-Jensen) or liquid media remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, confirmation of viability, and drug susceptibility testing, despite its longer turnaround time (weeks).",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "In Tuberculous Meningitis, the CSF glucose concentration is typically significantly reduced (<40 mg/dL or <40% of blood glucose) due to increased utilization by mycobacteria and inflammatory cells, and impaired glucose transport across inflamed meninges. Protein is usually elevated, and a lymphocytic pleocytosis (elevated cell count) is common. Chloride levels are not a primary diagnostic marker.",
