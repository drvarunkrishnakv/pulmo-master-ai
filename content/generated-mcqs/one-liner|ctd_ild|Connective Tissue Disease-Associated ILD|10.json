    "deepDiveExplanation": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD) in 70-90% of patients, making it the CTD with the highest prevalence of ILD. ILD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SSc. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is also commonly associated with ILD, the prevalence within RA patients is typically lower (e.g., 10-30% clinically significant ILD, up to 60% on HRCT).",
