    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "tb_end_strategy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The National Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Elimination (NSP for TB Elimination) 2017-2025 sets an ambitious target for India to eliminate TB by 2025, five years ahead of the global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 2030. This plan outlines strategies for case finding, treatment, prevention, and building robust systems.",
    "highYieldPearl": "India's 2025 target for TB elimination is more ambitious than the global WHO End TB Strategy's 2030 target for reduction.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "tb_end_strategy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The WHO End TB Strategy is built on three main pillars: 1. Integrated, patient-centered care and prevention, 2. Bold policies and supportive systems, and 3. Intensified research and innovation. While Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is a crucial enabling factor and a broader health goal, it is not listed as one of the three *explicit* pillars of the End TB Strategy itself.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Remember the three explicit pillars: Care/Prevention, Policies/Systems, Research/Innovation. UHC is an enabler, not a pillar.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Universal Health Coverage is a very relevant concept in public health and TB control, making it a plausible but incorrect option. Candidates need to know the specific, formally defined pillars.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_end_strategy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "NIKSHAY is the unified ICT-enabled system for notification, patient management, and surveillance for TB in India. It serves as a single window for tracking every TB patient from diagnosis to treatment outcome, facilitating real-time data collection, monitoring, and program management. Notification of TB cases to NIKSHAY is mandatory in India.",
    "highYieldPearl": "NIKSHAY is central to TB surveillance, data-driven program management, and mandatory notification in India.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "All options relate to aspects of a TB program. The key is to identify the *primary* function of NIKSHAY, which is patient notification, tracking, and monitoring.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_end_strategy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "NIKSHAY Poshan Yojana (formerly known as the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme for Nutritional Support to TB Patients) provides Rs. 500 per month to all notified TB patients for the entire duration of their treatment. This is a critical component for improving treatment adherence and outcomes, as malnutrition is a significant risk factor for TB. The payments are processed through the NIKSHAY portal.",
    "highYieldPearl": "NIKSHAY Poshan Yojana directly addresses the nutritional needs of TB patients, a key social determinant of health.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Other options are related to health schemes in India, but NIKSHAY Poshan Yojana is specific to TB patient nutritional support. Candidates might confuse it with other DBT schemes if they don't know the specific nomenclature.",

    "topic": "tb_end_strategy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The WHO End TB Strategy sets ambitious targets for 2030 relative to the 2015 baseline: 90% reduction in TB incidence rate, 95% reduction in TB deaths, and zero TB-affected families facing catastrophic costs. It's crucial to distinguish between the incidence and mortality targets.",
    "highYieldPearl": "The reduction targets for TB incidence (90%) and TB deaths (95%) by 2030 are distinct and often confused. Remember 95% for deaths, 90% for incidence.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "trapAnalysis": "All options are plausible percentage reductions. Candidates must recall the specific, distinct targets for incidence versus mortality. 90% is for incidence, 95% for deaths.",
