    "question": "Which of the following N-stages is an absolute contraindication for curative surgical resection in NSCLC?",
    "options": {
      "A": "N1",
      "B": "N2",
      "C": "N3",
      "D": "N0"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lung_cancer_surgery",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "N3 disease, defined as contralateral mediastinal or hilar lymph node involvement, or supraclavicular/scalene lymph node involvement, is generally considered an absolute contraindication to curative surgical resection in NSCLC due to high rates of systemic recurrence and poor survival outcomes. M1 (distant metastasis) is also an absolute contraindication. N2 disease (ipsilateral mediastinal/subcarinal nodes) can be resectable in selected cases, often with neoadjuvant therapy.",
    "highYieldPearl": "N3 or M1 disease signifies non-resectable NSCLC for curative intent surgery.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "N2 disease is a common distractor as it represents locally advanced disease, but select N2 cases can be downstaged and resected. N3, however, typically indicates widespread disease beyond the scope of local curative resection.",

    "question": "The standard anatomical surgical resection for early-stage NSCLC (T1-T2 N0 M0) is which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Wedge resection",
      "B": "Segmentectomy",
      "C": "Lobectomy",
      "D": "Pneumonectomy"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lung_cancer_surgery",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Lobectomy with systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the standard of care for early-stage NSCLC (T1-T2 N0 M0) as it offers the best balance of local control and survival benefits. Sublobar resections (wedge, segmentectomy) are typically reserved for smaller peripheral tumors (<2 cm) or patients with significant comorbidities precluding lobectomy.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Lobectomy with lymphadenectomy is the gold standard for resectable early-stage NSCLC.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Wedge resection and segmentectomy are less extensive resections used in specific scenarios (e.g., very small peripheral tumors, compromised lung function) but are not the 'standard' for all early-stage resectable NSCLC.",

    "question": "Curative surgical resection of a Pancoast tumor typically involves which approach?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Standard lobectomy",
      "B": "Bronchial sleeve resection",
      "C": "En bloc chest wall resection",
      "D": "Bilobectomy"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lung_cancer_surgery",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Pancoast tumors (superior sulcus tumors) are NSCLCs located in the apex of the lung, often invading the chest wall, brachial plexus, or subclavian vessels. Curative resection typically requires an en bloc resection of the lung apex, involved chest wall structures (ribs, vertebrae), and sometimes neurovascular structures, often preceded by neoadjuvant chemoradiation to improve resectability and outcomes.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Pancoast tumor surgery often requires a multidisciplinary, en bloc chest wall resection.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "A standard lobectomy would not adequately address the chest wall invasion characteristic of Pancoast tumors. Bronchial sleeve resection is for central tumors involving the main bronchus, and bilobectomy is for tumors involving two lobes.",

    "question": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation is primarily indicated in NSCLC surgical management for which purpose?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To reduce surgical complications",
      "B": "To downstage locally advanced disease",
      "C": "To prevent distant metastases post-operatively",
      "D": "To improve patient nutritional status"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "lung_cancer_surgery",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or chemoradiation) is administered before surgery primarily to downstage locally advanced NSCLC (e.g., N2 disease or T3/T4 tumors), making it more amenable to complete surgical resection (R0 resection) and improving overall survival rates. While it may also reduce the risk of local recurrence and potentially distant metastases, its primary role in the surgical context is downstaging and improving resectability.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Neoadjuvant therapy downstages locally advanced NSCLC to improve resectability and survival outcomes.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "While neoadjuvant therapy can reduce the risk of recurrence (C), its direct and primary indication for *surgical management* is to make the tumor surgically resectable or to achieve a more complete resection. It does not directly reduce surgical complications (A) or improve nutritional status (D).",

    "question": "Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS lobectomy for NSCLC is associated with which of the following?",

      "A": "Increased intraoperative blood loss",
      "B": "Longer hospital stay",
      "C": "Reduced post-operative pain",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lung_cancer_surgery",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy is a minimally invasive approach that offers several advantages over traditional open thoracotomy for early-stage NSCLC. These benefits include reduced post-operative pain, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, and comparable oncologic outcomes (e.g., recurrence rates and survival) when performed by experienced surgeons for appropriately selected patients.",
    "highYieldPearl": "VATS lobectomy offers reduced morbidity (pain, hospital stay) with equivalent oncologic outcomes for early NSCLC compared to open surgery.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "VATS typically results in *less* blood loss and *shorter* hospital stays. For early-stage NSCLC, recurrence rates are comparable to open surgery, not higher, when appropriate oncologic principles are followed.",
