This definition is critical for guiding appropriate treatment regimens, as standard first-line therapy containing these drugs would be ineffective. Other forms of resistance include mono-resistance (resistance to one first-line drug), poly-resistance (resistance to more than one first-line drug, but not both H and R), Pre-XDR TB (MDR-TB plus resistance to any fluoroquinolone), and XDR TB (MDR-TB plus resistance to any fluoroquinolone and at least one additional Group A drug, typically an injectable or bedaquiline/linezolid).",

The absence of hybridization to wild-type probes for rpoB and/or the presence of hybridization to specific mutation probes (e.g., rpoB MUT1, MUT2A, MUT2B, MUT3) indicates the presence of mutations associated with Rifampicin resistance.

The classic CT finding of diffuse tiny nodules, coupled with extrapulmonary involvement (hepatosplenomegaly), points strongly to miliary TB.

The 'subintimal granulomatous lesion in a segmental pulmonary vein' is a specific, though rare, pathological finding known as a Weigart focus. These foci represent granulomatous lesions within the intima of blood vessels, particularly pulmonary veins, and are important as they can erode and lead to hematogenous dissemination of the bacilli. The subpleural calcified nodules could represent healed Simon foci, which are old healed subpleural lesions resulting from prior hematogenous spread, but the question asks for the best description including the *active* disease and the specific pathological finding, which Weigart focus directly addresses.",

Tuberculous pleurisy is a common extrapulmonary manifestation of TB, often occurring as a complication of primary infection. Sputum AFB smears are frequently negative in tuberculous pleural effusion because the infection is primarily confined to the pleura without significant communication with the airways.

    "topic": "sleep_physiology",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), located in the anterior hypothalamus, is the master circadian pacemaker in mammals. It receives direct light input from the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract and synchronizes endogenous biological rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle, with the external light-dark cycle.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "sleep_physiology",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "During REM sleep, the body's thermoregulatory mechanisms are effectively suspended. This leads to a state of 'poikilothermy' or 'cold-bloodedness,' where the body loses its ability to maintain a stable core temperature through shivering, sweating, or vasoconstriction/dilation in response to environmental changes. This is distinct from NREM sleep where thermoregulation is actively maintained.",
    "highYieldPearl": "REM sleep is characterized by poikilothermy (loss of thermoregulation).",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "trapAnalysis": "While shivering and sweating thresholds are indeed altered during REM sleep (e.g., suppressed heat loss responses), the overarching characteristic is the complete failure of thermoregulation, leading to poikilothermy. Stable core body temperature is generally maintained during NREM sleep.",
