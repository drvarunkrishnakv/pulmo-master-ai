    "question": "Which pulmonary physiological parameter significantly decreases during normal pregnancy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tidal Volume",
      "B": "Minute Ventilation",
      "C": "Inspiratory Capacity",
      "D": "Functional Residual Capacity"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "lung_pregnancy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "During pregnancy, the enlarging uterus elevates the diaphragm, leading to a reduction in residual volume (RV) and expiratory reserve volume (ERV). The sum of RV and ERV is the Functional Residual Capacity (FRC), which consequently decreases by approximately 20-25%. This reduction is compensated by an increase in tidal volume and minute ventilation to meet increased oxygen demands.",
    "highYieldPearl": "The decrease in FRC during pregnancy predisposes pregnant women to earlier desaturation during apnea and rapid atelectasis.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Tidal volume and minute ventilation *increase* during pregnancy. Inspiratory capacity may remain unchanged or slightly increase. The key change is the decrease in FRC, RV, and ERV due to diaphragmatic elevation.",

    "question": "Which anti-tuberculous drug is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy due to its teratogenic potential?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Isoniazid",
      "B": "Rifampicin",
      "C": "Ethambutol",
      "D": "Streptomycin"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "lung_pregnancy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that crosses the placenta and is known to cause irreversible ototoxicity (vestibular and auditory damage) in the fetus. Therefore, it is absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy. First-line drugs like Isoniazid, Rifampicin, and Ethambutol are generally considered safe and recommended for treating TB in pregnant women.",
    "highYieldPearl": "While Pyrazinamide's safety in pregnancy was historically debated, current guidelines (e.g., WHO, CDC) generally consider it safe and recommend its use in pregnant women with TB, especially for drug-sensitive TB.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Isoniazid, Rifampicin, and Ethambutol are cornerstone drugs for TB treatment and are considered safe during pregnancy. Pyrazinamide is also generally considered safe. Streptomycin is the clear contraindication due to fetal ototoxicity.",
