    "deepDiveExplanation": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a known tumor predisposition syndrome. The text explicitly states that NF1 patients have a high incidence of neoplasia, including rare cases of primary lung carcinosarcoma and primary lung rhabdomyosarcoma. The underlying pathophysiology involves the loss of neurofibromin protein, which accelerates the production of Ras proteins. Ras proteins play a central role in cell differentiation and growth. This dysregulation is implicated in the development of various tumors, including those of mesenchymal origin (like neurofibromas themselves, which are benign mesenchymal tumors, and rhabdomyosarcoma, a malignant mesenchymal tumor). Therefore, NF1 predisposing to primary lung tumors with mesenchymal differentiation due to Ras pathway dysregulation is an accurate and mechanistically supported statement.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rio's Take: NF1-associated lung tumors often have a mesenchymal component, with rhabdomyosarcoma and carcinosarcoma (which has both epithelial and mesenchymal features) being rare but important considerations due to the underlying Ras pathway dysregulation.",

      "B": "This option is accurate. The text links neurofibromin loss to accelerated Ras production, central to cell differentiation and growth. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a tumor of mesenchymal differentiation, and its association with NF1 is explicitly mentioned. This option connects the cellular pathology to the specific tumor type.",

While MPNSTs are sarcomas and a significant complication of NF1, the text does not state that *pulmonary neurofibromas* (which are a type of neurofibroma) commonly *transform* into high-grade primary lung sarcomas. MPNSTs are malignant tumors of nerve sheath origin, often arising de novo or from pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas, but this option's phrasing about 'pulmonary neurofibromas commonly transform' is not directly supported."

The text states, 'Maximal lung lymph flow increases more when the microvascular wall has been injured than when hydrostatic pressure alone is increased, but even this augmented lymphatic pumping capability is insufficient.' This implies the barrier injury is primary.",
      "D": "Incorrect.
