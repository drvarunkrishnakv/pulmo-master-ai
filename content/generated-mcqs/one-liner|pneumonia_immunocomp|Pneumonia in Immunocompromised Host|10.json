    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "pneumonia_immunocomp",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is the most common opportunistic infection and cause of pneumonia in HIV-infected individuals, particularly when the CD4 count falls below 200 cells/mm³. While bacterial pneumonias (e.g., S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae) are also common in HIV, their incidence is higher at relatively higher CD4 counts or in other immunocompromised states. M. tuberculosis is also prevalent in HIV but is distinct from PCP.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Always consider PCP in HIV patients with respiratory symptoms and CD4 < 200. Imaging often shows bilateral perihilar ground-glass opacities.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "pneumonia_immunocomp",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the drug of choice for primary and secondary prophylaxis against PCP due to its efficacy, broad spectrum, and affordability. It is typically initiated when CD4 count drops below 200 cells/mm³ or in other immunocompromised states (e.g., transplant recipients on high-dose steroids). Dapsone, atovaquone, and aerosolized pentamidine are alternative agents for patients intolerant to TMP-SMX.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "pneumonia_immunocomp",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The classic radiographic finding in PCP is bilateral, diffuse, interstitial infiltrates, often described as perihilar or ground-glass opacities on HRCT. These infiltrates result from alveolar inflammation and exudate. Lobar consolidation is more typical of bacterial pneumonia, cavitary lesions suggest tuberculosis, fungal infections, or necrotizing bacterial pneumonia, and pleural effusions are less common in PCP unless there are co-infections.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "pneumonia_immunocomp",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "While CMV PCR from blood or BAL can indicate CMV infection, a definitive diagnosis of CMV pneumonia requires histological evidence of viral cytopathic effect (e.g., 'owl's eye' inclusions) and/or positive immunohistochemistry for CMV antigens in lung tissue obtained via biopsy. Isolation of CMV from BAL culture is not sufficient as it can represent colonization without active disease, especially in transplant recipients.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",

    "trapAnalysis": "Many clinicians might choose BAL PCR, which indicates CMV presence in the lung. However, in immunocompromised patients, this can be colonization or reactivation without actual pneumonia.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "pneumonia_immunocomp",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "In febrile neutropenia, rapid empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is crucial. The initial regimen must cover common Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can cause rapidly fatal infections. Piperacillin-tazobactam is a common choice, as are other antipseudomonal beta-lactams (e.g., cefepime, meropenem, imipenem). Vancomycin is typically added only if there is suspicion for MRSA or catheter-related infection, not as initial monotherapy.",

Candida species are more common causes of bloodstream infections but less frequently cause primary pneumonia. Cryptococcus is seen, but less frequently than Aspergillus, and Mucorales are associated with specific risk factors like diabetes or severe neutropenia.",

Beta-D-glucan is another non-specific fungal cell wall component. CRP and procalcitonin are general inflammatory markers. Sputum culture for Aspergillus can be positive due to colonization and lacks specificity for invasive disease.",

They are typically started concurrently with TMP-SMX. IVIG and G-CSF are not indicated for PCP. Bronchodilators are for bronchospasm, not the primary treatment for PCP.",
