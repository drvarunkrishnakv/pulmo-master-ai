    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "tb_eptb_pleural",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "While pleural fluid analysis (ADA, cell count, protein) is highly suggestive, and PCR has varying sensitivity, the gold standard for definitive diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis is the demonstration of caseating granulomas on pleural tissue histology and/or positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture from pleural tissue obtained via biopsy (thoracoscopic or needle).",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "tb_eptb_pleural",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "An adenosine deaminase (ADA) level greater than 40 U/L (or sometimes >35 U/L depending on the local cutoff) in pleural fluid is highly suggestive of tuberculous pleurisy, particularly in endemic areas. Values >80 U/L are even more specific. However, ADA can be elevated in other conditions like empyema, rheumatoid pleurisy, and lymphoma.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_eptb_pleural",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "In uncomplicated tuberculous pleurisy, the pleural effusion is typically lymphocytic predominant, meaning lymphocytes constitute more than 50% (often >70%) of the total nucleated cells. Early in the disease course (first few days), neutrophils may predominate, but this quickly shifts to lymphocytes.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "While Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is a very useful initial diagnostic step, providing cytological evidence of granulomatous inflammation, it often lacks sufficient tissue for definitive culture and comprehensive histopathology. Excisional biopsy allows for thorough histological examination (identifying caseating granulomas) and provides ample tissue for mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing, making it the definitive diagnostic method.",

Other causes of low pleural fluid glucose include empyema, rheumatoid pleurisy, and malignancy.",

    "topic": "tb_eptb_pleural",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Paradoxical worsening, or Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), is a recognized phenomenon in tuberculosis treatment. It is particularly common in tuberculous lymphadenitis, where existing lymph nodes may enlarge, new nodes may appear, or existing nodes may suppurate despite effective anti-tubercular therapy. This is thought to be due to an exaggerated immune response as the immune system recovers and becomes more effective at clearing mycobacterial antigens.",
