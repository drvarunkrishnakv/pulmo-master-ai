      "A": "Vagal-mediated reflex bronchoconstriction",
      "B": "Repeated microaspiration of gastric contents",
      "C": "Systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine release",
      "D": "Impaired diaphragmatic excursion"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "gerd_lung",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Repeated microaspiration of even microscopic amounts of gastric acid and pepsin into the distal airways is a significant pathological mechanism in the development and progression of various chronic lung diseases, including interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), by inducing chronic inflammation and fibrotic changes.",
    "highYieldPearl": "While vagal reflexes contribute to bronchospasm (e.g., in asthma), microaspiration is the key driver of direct parenchymal damage in GERD-associated chronic lung diseases like IPF.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option A (vagal reflex) is a major mechanism for GERD-induced asthma exacerbations and bronchospasm but less directly for parenchymal inflammation and fibrosis. Options C and D are less direct or not primary mechanisms.",

    "question": "What is the gold standard diagnostic test for pathological gastroesophageal reflux in patients with suspected GERD-related chronic cough?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Esophageal manometry",
      "B": "Barium esophagogram",
      "C": "24-hour esophageal pH monitoring",
      "D": "High-resolution impedance-pH monitoring"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "gerd_lung",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "While 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring detects acid reflux, high-resolution impedance-pH monitoring is considered the gold standard for evaluating GERD, especially in extra-esophageal manifestations like chronic cough. It can detect both acid and non-acid reflux episodes (liquid and gas), and allows for correlation with symptoms, which is crucial as non-acid reflux can also trigger cough.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Non-acid reflux, detectable by impedance monitoring, can be a significant trigger for chronic cough, even when pH monitoring is normal, making impedance-pH monitoring superior for extra-esophageal GERD.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option C (24-hour pH monitoring) is a common answer for general GERD diagnosis, but for extra-esophageal symptoms like chronic cough, where non-acid reflux plays a significant role, impedance-pH monitoring (D) provides more comprehensive data and is thus considered superior/gold standard in these specific contexts. Barium swallow (B) is for anatomical issues, and manometry (A) is for motility, not reflux per se.",
