    "topic": "asthma_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Bronchodilator reversibility is a key diagnostic feature of asthma. A significant response is typically defined as an increase in FEV1 of >12% from baseline AND an absolute increase of >200 mL after administration of a short-acting bronchodilator (e.g., 400 mcg salbutamol). This criterion helps differentiate asthma from other obstructive lung diseases like COPD.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "A methacholine challenge test assesses bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), a hallmark of asthma. A positive test is defined as a fall in FEV1 of 20% or more from baseline (PC20) at a methacholine concentration of 8 mg/mL or less. While some guidelines may consider up to 16 mg/mL, <8 mg/mL is a more definitive and commonly accepted threshold for clinical significance.",
