The initial insult targets the alveolar-capillary membrane, comprising alveolar epithelial cells (Type I and II pneumocytes) and capillary endothelial cells.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "ards_pathophys",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "In ARDS, damaged alveoli become filled with fluid and collapse (atelectasis), or are perfused but not ventilated. This creates areas of very low ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) ratio, primarily intrapulmonary shunting, where blood flows past non-ventilated alveoli, leading to venous admixture and severe hypoxemia that is often refractory to supplemental oxygen.",

This directly translates to a significant decrease in lung compliance (change in volume for a given change in pressure).",

Airway resistance (C) is not typically increased in ARDS unless there's concomitant bronchospasm. Diffusing capacity (D) will be impaired, but decreased compliance is a more fundamental and early physiological change reflecting the lung mechanics.",

In ARDS, this barrier is compromised, leading to a 'protein-rich' exudate in the alveoli. In hydrostatic (cardiogenic) pulmonary edema, the barrier is largely intact, and fluid extravasation is due to increased hydrostatic pressure, resulting in a 'protein-poor' transudate.",
