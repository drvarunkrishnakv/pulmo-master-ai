    "topic": "osa_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Polysomnography (Type I PSG) is considered the gold standard as it provides a comprehensive assessment of sleep architecture, respiratory events, cardiac activity, and oxygenation by simultaneously recording multiple physiological parameters in an attended setting.",
    "highYieldPearl": "PSG offers the most complete picture of sleep and respiratory disturbances, crucial for complex cases or when other sleep disorders are suspected.",

    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "HSATs (Type III/IV) are increasingly common for diagnosis, but they are not the 'gold standard' as they lack full sleep staging and are less comprehensive than attended PSG.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "The ODI is a common metric in sleep studies, representing the number of times per hour of sleep that the oxygen saturation drops by a specified percentage. The AASM 2012 criteria commonly use a ≥3% desaturation threshold for scoring respiratory events, and this is often applied to ODI calculations as well.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "HSATs typically do not include electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), or electromyography (EMG) channels, which are essential for objectively determining sleep stages (REM, NREM stages) and thus accurate total sleep time.
