    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lam",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) cells are abnormal smooth muscle-like cells that pathognomonically express melanocytic markers, most notably HMB-45 (human melanoma black-45). HMB-45 recognizes the gp100 protein and is crucial for the histological diagnosis of LAM, differentiating it from other cystic lung diseases.",
    "highYieldPearl": "HMB-45 positivity is a key diagnostic immunohistochemical feature for LAM cells.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "CD68 is a marker for macrophages, S100 for neural crest-derived cells (e.g., melanoma, schwannoma), and CK-7 for epithelial cells. Only HMB-45 is specific for LAM cells in this context.",

    "question": "The primary therapeutic agent targeting mTOR pathway in Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Pirfenidone",
      "B": "Nintedanib",
      "C": "Sirolimus",
      "D": "Azithromycin"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lam",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Sirolimus (rapamycin) is an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor, which has been shown to stabilize lung function, reduce chylous effusions, and improve quality of life in patients with LAM. It targets the dysregulated mTOR pathway, a key driver of LAM cell proliferation and survival. Everolimus is another mTOR inhibitor used for LAM, particularly in the context of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.",
    "highYieldPearl": "mTOR inhibitors (Sirolimus/Everolimus) are the current standard medical treatment for LAM.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Pirfenidone and Nintedanib are antifibrotic drugs used for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. Azithromycin has anti-inflammatory properties but is not a primary targeted therapy for LAM.",
