    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "tb_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Mycobacterial culture, particularly liquid culture systems like MGIT, remains the gold standard for diagnosing active tuberculosis. It allows for definitive identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and provides isolates for comprehensive drug susceptibility testing.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "GeneXpert MTB/RIF is a rapid molecular test but does not replace culture for definitive diagnosis and comprehensive drug susceptibility testing. Smear microscopy has low sensitivity, and chest X-ray is suggestive but not diagnostic.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "tb_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "GeneXpert MTB/RIF is a fully automated, real-time PCR-based assay endorsed by WHO. It detects M. tuberculosis DNA and mutations associated with rifampicin resistance (primarily in the rpoB gene) directly from sputum samples, providing results within two hours.",
    "highYieldPearl": "GeneXpert is a critical tool for rapid diagnosis of TB and early detection of rifampicin resistance, which is a surrogate marker for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Truenat MTB also detects MTB and rifampicin resistance but is a different platform. Line Probe Assay (LPA) requires a positive smear or culture and detects resistance to multiple drugs. LAMP is a different molecular amplification method.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), such as QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, measure the T-cell immune response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10, TB7.7). These antigens are absent from the BCG vaccine strain and most non-tuberculous mycobacteria, making IGRAs less prone to false-positive results in BCG-vaccinated individuals compared to TST.",
    "highYieldPearl": "IGRAs are the preferred method for diagnosing latent TB infection in populations with prior BCG vaccination or those who may have been exposed to non-tuberculous mycobacteria.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "The Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), also known as the Mantoux test, uses PPD, which contains antigens shared with BCG and NTM, leading to cross-reactivity and false positives in vaccinated individuals. Chest X-ray is not a direct diagnostic test for LTBI.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) has a low sensitivity, typically ranging from 20-60%, because it requires a high bacterial load (approximately 5,000-10,000 bacilli/mL of sputum) to be positive. This makes it less effective for diagnosing paucibacillary disease, extrapulmonary TB, or TB in immunocompromised patients.",
    "highYieldPearl": "A negative sputum smear does not rule out active pulmonary tuberculosis, necessitating further diagnostic tests like culture or molecular assays.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Specificity is generally high in endemic areas (though NTM can cause false positives). Reproducibility is good with proper training. Cost-effectiveness is a strength, not a limitation.",

    "topic": "tb_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism, and its levels are elevated in conditions with high cellular turnover, particularly T-lymphocyte activity. In pleural fluid, an ADA level above a specific cutoff (typically 30-40 U/L, varying by region) is highly sensitive and specific for tuberculous pleurisy.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "tb_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest offers superior spatial resolution compared to plain chest radiography. It can detect subtle parenchymal changes such as centrilobular nodules, 'tree-in-bud' opacities, small cavitations, and bronchiectasis, which are often missed on conventional X-rays, aiding in the diagnosis of early or atypical pulmonary TB.",
    "highYieldPearl": "HRCT is particularly useful in evaluating complex TB cases, suspected multi-drug resistant TB, or when differentiating TB from other lung pathologies.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Chest X-ray is the initial screening tool but lacks the sensitivity for subtle lesions. Fluoroscopy and ultrasound have limited roles in detailed pulmonary parenchymal evaluation.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "tb_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "First-line Line Probe Assays (e.g., GenoType MTBDRplus) are molecular tests that detect specific mutations in the *rpoB* gene (for rifampicin resistance) and the *katG* and *inhA* genes (for isoniazid resistance). They can be performed directly on smear-positive sputum samples or mycobacterial cultures, providing results within 1-2 days.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Liquid culture systems (e.g., MGIT, BACTEC) are significantly more sensitive than solid media cultures and smear microscopy for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They can detect very low bacterial loads (10-100 bacilli/mL), making them superior for diagnosing paucibacillary forms of TB, such as extrapulmonary TB or in immunocompromised patients where bacterial burden is often low.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_diagnosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The characteristic histopathological feature of tuberculosis is the formation of granulomas, which are organized collections of epithelioid macrophages, often surrounded by lymphocytes and fibroblasts. A key distinguishing feature, though not universally present, is central caseous necrosis, a 'cheese-like' amorphous material resulting from cellular destruction.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Histopathological examination of tissue biopsies (e.g., lymph node, pleura, lung) is often crucial for diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis and can guide further investigations like AFB staining or molecular tests on the tissue.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
