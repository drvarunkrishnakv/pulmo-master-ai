    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "niv",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "EPAP (Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure) increases intrathoracic pressure, which reduces venous return to the heart, thereby decreasing cardiac preload. This helps alleviate pulmonary congestion in cardiogenic pulmonary edema.",
    "highYieldPearl": "NIV's EPAP component significantly reduces cardiac preload, a key benefit in cardiogenic pulmonary edema.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "While NIV generally decreases work of breathing and can improve oxygenation (partially via increased FRC), the most direct and primary mechanism of EPAP in reducing pulmonary edema is the reduction of preload. Afterload reduction is also a benefit, but preload is more directly impacted by venous return reduction.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "niv",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "NIV provides positive inspiratory pressure (IPAP), which assists the patient's own inspiratory effort, thereby offloading the respiratory muscles and directly reducing the work of breathing.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "niv",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "While pressures can vary, 20-25 cmH2O is generally considered the practical upper limit for IPAP in NIV to minimize gastric insufflation, patient discomfort, and potential barotrauma, while still achieving ventilatory support.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Effective NIV aims for the lowest pressures to achieve therapeutic goals, typically not exceeding 25 cmH2O IPAP due to gastric insufflation risk.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "niv",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "niv",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "CO2 removal (ventilation) is primarily determined by minute ventilation, which is the product of tidal volume and respiratory rate. In BiPAP, the pressure support (IPAP minus EPAP) directly influences the tidal volume delivered with each breath, thus impacting CO2 clearance.",
    "highYieldPearl": "CO2 removal during BiPAP is governed by the pressure support (IPAP-EPAP) and respiratory rate, which together determine minute ventilation.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "EPAP primarily affects oxygenation and counteracts intrinsic PEEP. FiO2 solely affects oxygenation. While respiratory rate contributes to minute ventilation, the pressure support (IPAP-EPAP) is the direct ventilator control that augments tidal volume.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "niv",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Full-face masks (or oronasal masks) are generally preferred for acute NIV initiation because they provide a better seal, minimize air leak (especially with mouth breathing), and are more effective in delivering target pressures.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
