    "topic": "asthma_management",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "According to GINA guidelines, Step 2 asthma is characterized by symptoms occurring more than twice a month but less than daily. The preferred daily controller therapy for this step is a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). While GINA 2023 also offers low-dose ICS-formoterol PRN as a preferred reliever for Step 1 and Step 2, a daily controller remains a cornerstone for persistent asthma.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "GINA 2023 guidelines emphasize a 'preventer-reliever' approach. The preferred reliever for all adult asthma severity levels (Steps 1-5) is low-dose inhaled corticosteroid-formoterol PRN. This strategy ensures that even with reliever use, patients receive some anti-inflammatory benefit, reducing the risk of exacerbations compared to SABA monotherapy.",

Chronic OCS use carries significant side effects, so it is a last resort.",
