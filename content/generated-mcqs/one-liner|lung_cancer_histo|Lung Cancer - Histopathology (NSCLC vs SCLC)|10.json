    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lung_cancer_histo",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) is characterized by small cells with scant cytoplasm, finely granular chromatin, absent or inconspicuous nucleoli, and a high mitotic rate. Nuclear molding, where nuclei conform to each other's shapes, is a classic and highly characteristic feature. Crush artifact is also common due to the fragility of the cells.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Nuclear molding and crush artifact are key microscopic findings for SCLC. SCLC cells are typically 2-3 times the size of a lymphocyte.",
