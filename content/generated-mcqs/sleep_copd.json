While microscopy can identify the presence of AFB, it provides no information on the genetic makeup or drug susceptibility profile of the bacilli.

The presence of either confirms Isoniazid resistance.\nSince the patient is resistant to both Rifampicin and Isoniazid, the correct classification is Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB).

The GenoType MTBDDRplus assay provides further molecular insights: \n1.  **Rifampicin Resistance:** The absence of rpoB wild type probes and presence of rpoB mutation probe 2A definitively confirms Rifampicin resistance. The rpoB gene is the primary target for Rifampicin resistance mutations.\n2.  **Isoniazid Resistance:** While the katG wild type probe is present (suggesting no common katG mutation for high-level INH resistance), the absence of inhA wild type probe 1 and presence of inhA mutation probe 3A indicates a mutation in the inhA promoter region. inhA mutations confer Isoniazid resistance, often at a low to moderate level. Isoniazid resistance can be mediated by mutations in either the katG gene or the inhA promoter region (or occasionally other genes). Since an inhA mutation is detected, the strain is resistant to Isoniazid.\nMulti-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) is defined as resistance to at least both Rifampicin and Isoniazid.

The c-DST results indicate resistance to Moxifloxacin and Kanamycin, in addition to the previously identified resistance to Isoniazid and Rifampicin.

Resistance to any fluoroquinolone in an MDR-TB patient classifies the condition as Pre-Extensively Drug-Resistant TB (Pre-XDR-TB).\n2.  **Resistance to Kanamycin:** Kanamycin is a second-line injectable anti-TB drug (though no longer recommended by WHO for routine use due to toxicity, it's still used for classification in some contexts/older definitions, and exams frequently test this historical knowledge). \nAccording to the WHO 2021 definition, Extensively Drug-Resistant TB (XDR-TB) is defined as MDR-TB plus resistance to any fluoroquinolone AND at least one additional Group A drug (which includes bedaquiline, linezolid, pretomanid, or moxifloxacin if other Group A drugs are susceptible and Moxifloxacin is resistant). However, for NEET-SS, the older, simpler definition of XDR-TB (MDR-TB + Fluoroquinolone resistance + second-line injectable resistance) is frequently tested.
