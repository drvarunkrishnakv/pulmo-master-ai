Here, the FEV1 increased by 450 mL (which is >200 mL) and by 18.75% (which is >12%).

Therefore, maintaining the current effective therapy while aggressively addressing his smoking and reflux is the most appropriate and cautious approach to ensure sustained control and reduce future risk.",

Traditional severity classification is based on symptom frequency, nocturnal awakenings, SABA reliever use, and lung function (FEV1) BEFORE starting controller therapy.\n\nCriteria:\n*   **Intermittent Asthma:** Symptoms ≤2 times/week; nocturnal symptoms ≤2 times/month; SABA use ≤2 times/week; FEV1 >80% predicted.\n*   **Mild Persistent Asthma:** Symptoms >2 times/week but not daily; nocturnal symptoms 3-4 times/month; SABA use >2 times/week but not daily; FEV1 >80% predicted.\n*   **Moderate Persistent Asthma:** Daily symptoms; nocturnal symptoms >1 time/week; daily SABA use; FEV1 60-80% predicted.\n*   **Severe Persistent Asthma:** Continuous symptoms; nightly nocturnal symptoms; SABA use several times/day; FEV1 <60% predicted.\n\nIn this patient's case:\n1.  **Daytime Symptoms:** 3-4 times per week (exceeds intermittent, consistent with mild persistent).\n2.  **Nocturnal Symptoms:** 2-3 times per month (exceeds intermittent, consistent with mild persistent).\n3.  **SABA use:** 3-4 times per week (exceeds intermittent, consistent with mild persistent).\n4.  **FEV1:** 85% of predicted (>80%, consistent with intermittent or mild persistent).\n\nSince the patient consistently exceeds the criteria for intermittent asthma in multiple domains (symptom frequency, nocturnal awakenings, SABA use) but does not meet the criteria for daily symptoms or significantly impaired FEV1, the most appropriate classification is **Mild Persistent Asthma**.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rio's Take: Initial asthma severity classification (intermittent, mild, moderate, severe persistent) is based on symptom frequency, nocturnal awakenings, reliever use, and lung function *before* starting controller therapy.

For patients with infrequent symptoms (like this patient, falling under GINA Step 1 or Step 2), the preferred initial treatment strategy is as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol. This approach provides both rapid symptom relief (formoterol) and anti-inflammatory benefit (ICS), addressing the underlying inflammation even with infrequent symptoms and reducing the risk of exacerbations.",
