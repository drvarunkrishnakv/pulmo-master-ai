    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "asthma_severe",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "GINA defines severe asthma as asthma that requires treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a second controller (and/or systemic corticosteroids) to prevent it from becoming 'uncontrolled' or that remains 'uncontrolled' despite this therapy. The GINA criteria specify that this state must persist for at least 6 months of treatment, or if the asthma requires systemic corticosteroids to remain controlled.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "Sputum eosinophil percentage is a direct and highly specific measure of airway eosinophilic inflammation, a hallmark of Type 2 asthma. High sputum eosinophils (e.g., >3%) strongly predict response to anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab, reslizumab) and anti-IL-5R (benralizumab) therapies. While FeNO is also a Type 2 biomarker, sputum eosinophils are often considered more directly linked to the IL-5 pathway.",
