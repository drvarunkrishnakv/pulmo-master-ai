    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lung_cancer_immuno",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1) is expressed on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells. It binds to PD-1 (Programmed Death-1) receptors on activated T-cells, leading to T-cell anergy, exhaustion, and suppression of anti-tumor immunity. Blocking this interaction with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies restores T-cell function and promotes tumor cell killing.",

This is followed by eventual tumor shrinkage. It highlights the need for continued treatment beyond initial radiographic progression if the patient is clinically stable.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB), defined as the total number of somatic mutations per megabase of sequenced DNA, correlates with the number of neoantigens presented by tumor cells. Higher TMB is generally associated with improved response rates and survival benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors across various cancers, including NSCLC.",
