      "C": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the chest",
      "D": "Bronchoscopy with BAL"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "bronchiectasis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "HRCT is the gold standard for diagnosing bronchiectasis, clearly visualizing bronchial dilatation, lack of tapering, and bronchial wall thickening. It can detect changes not visible on plain chest X-ray and provides detailed anatomical information crucial for diagnosis and assessing extent.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Concomitant signet ring sign (bronchial diameter > adjacent pulmonary artery diameter) is a classic HRCT finding.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "While Chest X-Ray may show suggestive signs, it lacks sensitivity and specificity. MRI is not routinely used for primary diagnosis due to lower spatial resolution for airways. Bronchoscopy is diagnostic for underlying causes but not for the anatomical diagnosis of bronchiectasis itself.",

      "C": "Pulmonary vascular remodeling",
      "D": "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "bronchiectasis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The 'vicious cycle' hypothesis describes how initial infection or injury leads to impaired mucociliary clearance, chronic bacterial colonization, and persistent inflammation. This inflammation causes further airway damage, perpetuating the cycle of infection, inflammation, and structural damage.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Chronic inflammation and infection lead to progressive airway damage, forming a self-perpetuating cycle.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "Other options describe aspects of lung disease but do not encapsulate the core, self-perpetuating mechanism specific to bronchiectasis. Alveolar dysfunction is more relevant to interstitial lung diseases or emphysema, while vascular remodeling is primary in pulmonary hypertension.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "bronchiectasis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "While macrolides have some antimicrobial effects, their primary benefit in long-term therapy for bronchiectasis (especially at sub-inhibitory doses) is immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory. They reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines, inhibit neutrophil recruitment, and impair bacterial virulence factors, ultimately reducing exacerbation frequency.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Macrolides exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects beyond their direct antimicrobial action in chronic respiratory diseases.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Moderate",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option A is a partial truth; while they can reduce bacterial load, the anti-inflammatory effect is considered the dominant mechanism for long-term benefits in bronchiectasis. Options C and D are incorrect as macrolides are not primary agents for fungal or mycobacterial infections.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "bronchiectasis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Post-infectious causes, particularly severe childhood infections like pertussis, measles, or tuberculosis, remain the most frequently identified etiology for non-CF bronchiectasis in adults globally, even if a significant proportion remains idiopathic.",
    "highYieldPearl": "A history of severe childhood respiratory infections should always prompt consideration for underlying bronchiectasis.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "While primary ciliary dyskinesia, immunodeficiency, and ABPA are important causes of bronchiectasis, they are individually less common than the broad category of post-infectious causes. A significant proportion of cases also remain idiopathic even after thorough investigation.",
