His biomarker profile indicates low T2 inflammation: blood eosinophil count (80 cells/µL) is below the threshold for Dupilumab (≥150 cells/mL) and Mepolizumab (typically ≥300 cells/µL or other specific thresholds, but generally not for low eosinophils), and FeNO (18 ppb) is below the Dupilumab threshold (>25 ppb). His serum total IgE (15 kU/L) is also low, and he lacks specific IgE-mediated allergies, ruling out Omalizumab. Tezepelumab (anti-TSLP) is approved for severe asthma and is particularly beneficial for patients who do not have elevated T2 inflammatory markers, as it acts on upstream pathways (TSLP from epithelial cells) that are involved in both T2-high and T2-low asthma. Therefore, Tezepelumab is the most appropriate choice.",

According to the provided context, the immediate consequence of this increased resistance is 'diminished flow rates / premature airway closure'. While premature airway closure (especially during expiration) is a critical component of airflow obstruction and leads to air trapping, the most direct and immediate physiological effect of increased resistance itself is a reduction in the rate of airflow. Increased FRC (hyperinflation/air trapping) and activation of accessory muscles are subsequent consequences, occurring after the initial reduction in flow and premature closure of airways. Therefore, diminished flow rates represent the earliest and most direct functional impact of increased resistance.",
