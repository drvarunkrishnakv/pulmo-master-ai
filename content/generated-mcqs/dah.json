    "deepDiveExplanation": "Inhaled vasodilators, such as inhaled prostacyclins or nitric oxide, offer important physiological benefits in conditions like ARDS with associated pulmonary hypertension. Their primary advantage lies in their localized action: they preferentially dilate pulmonary vessels that perfuse well-ventilated alveoli. This mechanism improves ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) matching by redirecting blood flow away from poorly ventilated units, thereby improving hypoxemia and reducing pulmonary arterial pressure without causing significant systemic hemodynamic effects. This selective action contrasts with systemic vasodilators, which would cause generalized vasodilation and potentially lead to systemic hypotension.",

However, the primary rationale for initiating ECCO2R in such a scenario is not merely to treat these complications in isolation.

This allows for sustained lung protection without the deleterious effects of severe hypercapnia. ECCO2R is not primarily indicated for hypoxemia (Option B).

While Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was shown to be associated with 'significant improvement in FVC percent predicted' and has a 'tolerability and safety profile... superior' to cyclophosphamide, the text does not definitively state 'superior efficacy' in FVC improvement when directly comparing MMF to cyclophosphamide.
