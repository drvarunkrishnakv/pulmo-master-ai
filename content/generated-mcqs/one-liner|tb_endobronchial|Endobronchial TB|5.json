    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "tb_endobronchial",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Endobronchial tuberculosis (EBTB) can manifest in various morphological forms. While some classifications list edematous-hyperemic as most common, the ulcerative type, characterized by mucosal ulceration and caseous necrosis, is frequently encountered and often considered a hallmark of active disease, making it a high-yield concept for diagnosis.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Ulcerative EBTB is highly contagious due to open lesions shedding bacilli, and it's a common cause of positive sputum smears even with minimal parenchymal disease.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Other types like fibro-stenotic are often sequelae of healing, not primary active forms. Granular and caseous are also forms but less frequently cited as 'most common' compared to ulcerative or edematous-hyperemic in active disease.",

    "question": "The most characteristic bronchoscopic finding in active endobronchial tuberculosis is?",

      "A": "Diffuse mucosal edema",
      "B": "Ulceration with caseous material",
      "C": "Bronchial wall thickening",
      "D": "Mucopurulent secretions"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_endobronchial",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Bronchoscopy is crucial for diagnosing EBTB. Active EBTB typically presents with mucosal ulceration, often covered with yellowish caseous material, indicating active inflammation and necrosis. This finding is highly suggestive and aids in targeted biopsy and lavage for microbiological confirmation.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Always biopsy suspicious endobronchial lesions, especially in endemic areas, for histopathological and microbiological confirmation of TB.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Diffuse mucosal edema or bronchial wall thickening can be seen in various inflammatory conditions. Mucopurulent secretions are non-specific. The combination of ulceration and caseous material is more specific to active EBTB.",

      "D": "Pneumothorax"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_endobronchial",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Bronchial stenosis, ranging from mild narrowing to complete occlusion, is a significant complication of EBTB. It results from chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and scar formation in the bronchial wall, leading to airflow obstruction, recurrent infections, and post-obstructive bronchiectasis.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Early diagnosis and appropriate anti-tuberculous treatment of EBTB are crucial to prevent irreversible bronchial damage and subsequent stenosis.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Pleural effusion and cavitation are more commonly associated with parenchymal TB. Pneumothorax is a rare complication of TB in general and not a common sequela specifically of EBTB.",

      "A": "Reduce mycobacterial load",

      "C": "Improve drug penetration",
      "D": "Alleviate systemic symptoms"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "tb_endobronchial",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Corticosteroids are often used as an adjunct to anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) in EBTB, particularly in cases with significant inflammation or impending stenosis. Their anti-inflammatory action helps reduce edema and fibrosis in the bronchial wall, thereby preventing or ameliorating bronchial stenosis and preserving airway patency.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Corticosteroids should always be given *with* full ATT, never alone, in active TB, to avoid disseminated disease.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Corticosteroids do not reduce mycobacterial load directly or improve drug penetration. While they can alleviate systemic symptoms, their primary indication in EBTB is airway preservation by reducing inflammation and fibrosis.",

    "question": "Endobronchial tuberculosis most commonly results from which mechanism?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hematogenous spread",
      "B": "Lymphatic spread",
      "C": "Direct extension from parenchyma",
      "D": "Inhalation of aerosols"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "tb_endobronchial",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "EBTB can arise through several mechanisms. The most common include direct extension from an adjacent parenchymal lesion (e.g., a subpleural focus eroding into a bronchus) or expectoration of bacilli from a distant cavitary lesion with subsequent implantation. Lymphatic spread from hilar lymph nodes is also a recognized mechanism, often leading to extrinsic compression or direct invasion. Direct extension from parenchyma and implantation via expectoration are considered predominant.",
    "highYieldPearl": "EBTB patients often have co-existing parenchymal TB, which acts as the source of infection for the bronchial tree.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Hematogenous spread typically causes miliary TB or distant organ involvement. Inhalation causes primary parenchymal infection but doesn't directly explain EBTB without a primary focus eroding into the bronchus or expectoration of bacilli.",
