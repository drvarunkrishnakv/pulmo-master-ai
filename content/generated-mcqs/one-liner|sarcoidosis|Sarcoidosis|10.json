      "D": "Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "sarcoidosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Sarcoidosis is characterized by the presence of non-caseating (non-necrotizing) granulomas in affected tissues. These granulomas are composed of epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and lymphocytes. The absence of central necrosis is a key feature distinguishing sarcoid granulomas from those seen in tuberculosis or fungal infections.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Non-caseating granulomas are central to sarcoidosis diagnosis, but also seen in Crohn's disease, primary biliary cholangitis, and berylliosis, requiring careful clinical correlation and exclusion of other causes.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Option A (Caseating granulomas) is the classic hallmark of tuberculosis, a major differential diagnosis for sarcoidosis. Distinguishing between caseating and non-caseating granulomas is crucial for diagnosis.",

      "C": "Extrapulmonary involvement",
      "D": "Response to therapy"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "sarcoidosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Serum ACE levels are elevated in approximately 60-80% of patients with active sarcoidosis, particularly in those with a high granuloma burden. ACE is produced by epithelioid cells within the granulomas. While not diagnostic on its own, elevated ACE often reflects active disease and can be used to monitor disease activity and treatment response, though its utility is limited by low sensitivity and specificity.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Serum ACE is a supportive marker of sarcoidosis activity but is neither sensitive nor specific enough for diagnosis. It can be normal in active disease and elevated in other conditions like Gaucher's disease or hyperthyroidism.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "While ACE levels can decrease with effective therapy (suggesting response), its primary correlation is with the underlying inflammatory activity. It does not directly correlate with the degree of lung fibrosis, and while extrapulmonary involvement contributes to activity, 'disease activity' is the overarching concept.",

      "D": "Stage III"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "sarcoidosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The Scadding stages categorize pulmonary sarcoidosis based on chest X-ray findings: Stage 0 (normal CXR), Stage I (bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy only), Stage II (bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy with parenchymal infiltrates), Stage III (parenchymal infiltrates without hilar lymphadenopathy), and Stage IV (pulmonary fibrosis). Stage I has the highest rate of spontaneous remission.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Scadding staging is a prognostic indicator, not a measure of disease severity. Stage I sarcoidosis has the best prognosis, with up to 90% spontaneous resolution.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Confusing the stages is a common error. Stage 0 is a normal CXR, Stage II includes parenchymal involvement, and Stage III involves parenchymal disease without hilar lymphadenopathy, making Stage I the correct answer for isolated hilar lymphadenopathy.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "sarcoidosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common acute cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis, often presenting as painful, tender, red nodules on the shins. It is a non-specific inflammatory reaction associated with acute sarcoidosis, particularly Lofgren's syndrome, and generally indicates a good prognosis. Lupus pernio, while highly specific for sarcoidosis, is a chronic manifestation and less common overall.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Erythema nodosum is a marker of acute sarcoidosis and often correlates with a favorable prognosis, particularly when part of Lofgren's syndrome. Lupus pernio, however, indicates chronic, often severe disease.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "sarcoidosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are the cornerstone of treatment for symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis and other severe manifestations. Treatment is typically initiated for progressive lung disease, significant extrapulmonary involvement (e.g., cardiac, neurological, ocular), or debilitating symptoms. Other agents like methotrexate, azathioprine, or biologics are considered for steroid-sparing effects or refractory disease.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Initiate corticosteroids for symptomatic sarcoidosis, particularly if affecting vital organs or causing significant functional impairment. The goal is to control inflammation and prevent irreversible organ damage.",

    "topic": "sarcoidosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Lofgren's syndrome is an acute presentation of sarcoidosis characterized by the classic triad of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, erythema nodosum, and polyarthralgia (often ankle periarthritis). It generally has a benign course with a high rate of spontaneous remission and a good prognosis. Heerfordt's syndrome (uveoparotid fever) involves fever, parotid enlargement, anterior uveitis, and facial nerve palsy.",

      "D": "Decreased vitamin D receptor sensitivity"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "sarcoidosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The granulomas in sarcoidosis contain macrophages that express 1-alpha hydroxylase, an enzyme that converts inactive 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). This unregulated production of calcitriol leads to increased intestinal calcium absorption and bone resorption, resulting in hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, independent of parathyroid hormone levels.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is due to extrarenal production of calcitriol by activated macrophages within granulomas, leading to PTH-independent vitamin D overproduction.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "trapAnalysis": "Primary hyperparathyroidism (Option A) also causes hypercalcemia but is characterized by elevated PTH. In sarcoidosis, PTH levels are typically suppressed or normal. Calcitonin (Option B) lowers calcium. Decreased vitamin D receptor sensitivity (Option D) would lead to hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "sarcoidosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis generally requires a compatible clinical picture, characteristic radiological findings (e.g., bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy), and histopathological evidence of non-caseating granulomas from an involved organ, after excluding other granulomatous diseases. While elevated ACE and hypercalcemia are supportive, they are not diagnostic. The Kveim test is historical and no longer used.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Diagnosis of sarcoidosis is one of exclusion; histological confirmation of non-caseating granulomas is essential, but only in the context of typical clinical and radiological features and after ruling out other causes.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Elevated ACE (A) and serum calcium (D) are supportive but not diagnostic. The Kveim test (C) is an old skin test, no longer used due to lack of standardization and availability. Biopsy (B) provides the definitive histological evidence.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "Stage I sarcoidosis, characterized by bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy without parenchymal involvement, has the highest rate of spontaneous remission, occurring in up to 90% of cases. Spontaneous remission rates decrease with increasing stages, with Stage II resolving in 50-70% and Stage III in 10-30% of cases. Stage 0 implies no radiological disease, so there's nothing to resolve.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Spontaneous resolution is common in Stage I sarcoidosis, often negating the need for systemic corticosteroid therapy unless severe symptoms or extrapulmonary involvement are present.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "While Stage 0 technically has no disease to resolve, Stage I is the first stage with active disease that shows the highest rate of spontaneous resolution. Stages II and III have progressively lower rates of spontaneous remission, making Stage I the best answer.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "sarcoidosis",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Cranial neuropathies are the most frequent neurological manifestation of neurosarcoidosis, occurring in 50-75% of neurosarcoidosis patients. The facial nerve (CN VII) is most commonly affected, often bilaterally, leading to Bell's palsy-like symptoms. Aseptic meningitis is also common, but cranial nerve palsies are the single most frequent presentation.",
