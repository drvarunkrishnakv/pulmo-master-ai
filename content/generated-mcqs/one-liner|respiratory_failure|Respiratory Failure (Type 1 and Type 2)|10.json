The underlying issue is a failure of oxygen exchange at the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to impaired oxygenation of arterial blood.

    "deepDiveExplanation": "Type 2 respiratory failure (hypercapnic respiratory failure) is defined by a PaCO2 > 45 mmHg (and often an associated decrease in pH) with or without hypoxemia. It results from inadequate alveolar ventilation, meaning the lungs cannot adequately remove CO2 produced by the body.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "An increased A-a gradient indicates an inefficiency in oxygen transfer from the alveoli to the arterial blood. This is the hallmark of Type 1 respiratory failure, caused by V/Q mismatch, shunt, or diffusion limitation. Pure alveolar hypoventilation (Type 2 RF) with normal lung parenchyma typically has a normal A-a gradient.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "If the lung parenchyma is normal, the issue is not primarily with gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane (which would cause Type 1 RF). Instead, the problem lies with the 'pump' responsible for moving air in and out of the lungs. This includes neuromuscular disorders, chest wall deformities, or central drive depression, all leading to Type 2 RF.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "respiratory_failure",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "ARDS is characterized by widespread inflammation, leading to alveolar damage, collapse, and fluid filling. This results in areas of lung that are perfused but not ventilated, creating an absolute intrapulmonary shunt. Shunt is refractory to supplemental oxygen, explaining why ARDS patients often require high FiO2 and PEEP.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "respiratory_failure",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "NPPV is a cornerstone treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD leading to hypercapnic respiratory failure. It improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing, and decreases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and associated complications. While NPPV is used in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, it's primarily for hypoxemia, not hypercapnia in that context. Severe ARDS is often too severe for NPPV.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "PEEP maintains positive pressure in the alveoli at the end of expiration, preventing their collapse (de-recruitment). This increases the functional residual capacity, recruits collapsed alveoli, and redistributes extravascular lung water, ultimately reducing intrapulmonary shunt and improving oxygenation.",

    "topic": "respiratory_failure",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "An increasing respiratory rate (tachypnea) is often the body's initial compensatory mechanism to maintain minute ventilation in the face of increased work of breathing or impending muscle fatigue. As fatigue progresses, tidal volume may fall, and PaCO2 will eventually rise, indicating ventilatory failure.",
