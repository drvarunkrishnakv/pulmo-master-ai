    "question": "What is the reported diagnostic yield of medical thoracoscopy for malignant pleural effusion?",

      "A": "50-60%",
      "B": "70-80%",
      "C": "85-95%",
      "D": ">95%"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "thoracoscopy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy) allows direct visualization of the pleural surfaces and targeted biopsies. For malignant pleural effusions, it offers a significantly higher diagnostic yield (85-95%) compared to blind pleural biopsy (40-60%) or even CT-guided biopsy (60-70%), especially when previous biopsies have been non-diagnostic. It also allows for therapeutic interventions like talc pleurodesis.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Medical thoracoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing exudative pleural effusions of unknown etiology, particularly when malignancy is suspected.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Options are percentages, testing specific recall of diagnostic efficacy. Lower percentages are associated with blind biopsies. The 85-95% range is consistently cited in major textbooks.",

    "question": "Which of the following is an absolute contraindication for medical thoracoscopy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease",
      "B": "Uncorrectable coagulopathy",
      "C": "Previous pleurodesis",
      "D": "Small pleural space"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "thoracoscopy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Absolute contraindications for medical thoracoscopy include uncorrectable coagulopathy (e.g., INR > 1.5, platelets < 50,000 without correction), lack of adequate pleural space (lung fully expanded or extensive adhesions precluding safe entry), and patient refusal or inability to cooperate. Severe COPD, previous pleurodesis (depending on extent), and a small pleural space (if an adequate entry point can be found) are generally considered relative contraindications or technical challenges, not absolute prohibitions.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Uncorrectable coagulopathy is a major risk for hemorrhage during any invasive procedure and is a critical absolute contraindication.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Other options are relative contraindications or technical challenges, not absolute prohibitions. Distinguishing absolute from relative contraindications is crucial for patient safety in practice and for exam questions.",

    "question": "For definitive diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, which biopsy technique is generally considered superior?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Blind pleural biopsy",
      "B": "CT-guided core biopsy",
      "C": "Medical thoracoscopy",
      "D": "Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "thoracoscopy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "While medical thoracoscopy can provide good samples, Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) allows for larger, deeper, and multiple biopsies. This is often crucial for the complex histological diagnosis of mesothelioma, especially for distinguishing it from reactive mesothelial hyperplasia, which requires assessment of tissue architecture and immunohistochemical stains on adequate tissue. VATS also enables better staging and therapeutic interventions.",
    "highYieldPearl": "VATS offers the largest and deepest tissue samples, which are critical for the definitive diagnosis and staging of complex malignancies like mesothelioma.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Medical thoracoscopy is highly effective for many pleural malignancies, but for mesothelioma, the requirement for larger, deeper tissue samples for definitive diagnosis and staging often makes VATS the superior choice. The question specifically asks for 'definitive diagnosis' and 'superior' technique.",

    "question": "What is a common and often unavoidable complication following medical thoracoscopy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Significant hemorrhage",
      "B": "Persistent air leak",
      "C": "Pleural infection",
      "D": "Subcutaneous emphysema"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "thoracoscopy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Subcutaneous emphysema is a very common, usually self-limiting complication after thoracoscopy, resulting from air tracking from the pleural space into the subcutaneous tissues through the access site. While persistent air leak and significant hemorrhage are serious complications, they are less common than subcutaneous emphysema. Pleural infection is rare with sterile technique.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Subcutaneous emphysema is a frequent, usually benign, finding post-thoracoscopy due to transient air leakage into soft tissues around the port site.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Other options are serious complications, but subcutaneous emphysema is particularly common and often self-resolving, making it a distinct characteristic of the procedure's immediate aftermath. The question asks for a 'common and often unavoidable' complication, fitting subcutaneous emphysema well.",

    "question": "Talc pleurodesis performed during thoracoscopy primarily works by inducing what process?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Direct tumor cytotoxicity",
      "B": "Immunosuppression of pleural cells",
      "C": "Chemical irritation causing inflammation and fibrosis",
      "D": "Increased lymphatic drainage from the pleural space"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "thoracoscopy",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Talc acts as a potent sclerosant. When introduced into the pleural space, it causes a severe sterile inflammatory reaction. This inflammation leads to the formation of adhesions and fibrosis between the visceral and parietal pleura, effectively obliterating the pleural space and preventing the re-accumulation of fluid.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Talc pleurodesis induces a robust sterile inflammatory reaction in the pleura, leading to symphysis and preventing recurrent effusions.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "The other options describe incorrect or secondary mechanisms. The core mechanism is the induction of a strong inflammatory response leading to pleural fusion (symphysis) due to the chemical irritant properties of talc.",
