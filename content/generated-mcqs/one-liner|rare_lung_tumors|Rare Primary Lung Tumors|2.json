    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "rare_lung_tumors",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) is a rare, aggressive pediatric lung tumor. Approximately 70% of individuals with PPB have a germline mutation in the DICER1 gene, a ribonuclease III enzyme involved in microRNA processing. DICER1 syndrome is an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by an increased risk of developing various tumors, including PPB, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, cystic nephroma, thyroid nodules, and others.",
    "highYieldPearl": "DICER1 mutation is the hallmark genetic alteration in Pleuropulmonary Blastoma and indicates a familial cancer predisposition syndrome.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "EGFR, ALK, and KRAS are common oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), making them plausible distractors for a lung tumor question. However, they are not associated with PPB, which is a distinct pediatric tumor.",

    "question": "Pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma is strongly associated with which viral infection?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Human Papillomavirus (HPV)",
      "B": "Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)",
      "C": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV)",
      "D": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "rare_lung_tumors",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is a rare subtype of non-small cell lung carcinoma that histologically resembles nasopharyngeal carcinoma. It is characterized by poorly differentiated epithelial cells admixed with a prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. A strong association with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection is observed, particularly in endemic regions (e.g., East Asia), where virtually all cases are EBV-positive. This association suggests a potential role for EBV in its pathogenesis.",
    "highYieldPearl": "The strong association of Pulmonary LELC with EBV mirrors its nasopharyngeal counterpart, making EBV testing crucial in diagnosis and understanding its etiology.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Other viruses listed are common and can be associated with various conditions or cancers, but EBV has a specific and well-established link to LELC, especially in the lung and nasopharynx, distinguishing it from other viral associations.",
