    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "cap",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The CURB-65 score assesses CAP severity based on Confusion, Urea (>7 mmol/L), Respiratory rate (≥30 breaths/min), Blood pressure (systolic <90 mmHg or diastolic ≤60 mmHg), and age (≥65 years). Oxygen saturation is a critical vital sign for pneumonia assessment but is not a direct component of the CURB-65 score itself. It is, however, part of other severity scores like the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI/PORT) and is crucial for determining the need for hospitalization and oxygen therapy.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Remember CURB-65 for rapid bedside assessment of CAP severity. Each criterion scores 1 point; a score of 0-1 suggests outpatient management, 2 suggests inpatient, and ≥3 suggests severe CAP, often requiring ICU consideration.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "The trap lies in oxygen saturation being a highly relevant parameter in pneumonia. Candidates might incorrectly assume its inclusion due to its clinical importance in severity assessment, despite not being part of the specific CURB-65 acronym.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "cap",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Atypical pathogens (*Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, *Chlamydophila pneumoniae*, *Legionella pneumophila*) lack a cell wall or have unique cell wall structures, rendering beta-lactam antibiotics (which target peptidoglycan synthesis) ineffective. Macrolides (e.g., azithromycin, clarithromycin), tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline), and fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) are the main antibiotic classes effective against these organisms due to their mechanisms of action (e.g., protein synthesis inhibition for macrolides and tetracyclines, DNA gyrase inhibition for fluoroquinolones).",

It is highly specific (99%) and reasonably sensitive (70-99%), and results are available within hours, making it the most rapid and specific test for diagnosing *L. pneumophila* serogroup 1 CAP. Serology (antibody detection) is useful for retrospective diagnosis but not for acute management, and sputum Gram stain is often unrevealing as *Legionella* stains poorly.",

    "topic": "cap",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "According to IDSA 2019 guidelines, for otherwise healthy outpatients with CAP and no risk factors for drug-resistant *S. pneumoniae* or MRSA, first-line options include amoxicillin (1g TID), doxycycline, or a macrolide (e.g., azithromycin) if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is <25%. Amoxicillin is a strong recommendation for typical CAP coverage due to its efficacy and narrow spectrum. Fluoroquinolones (like levofloxacin) are generally reserved for patients with comorbidities or those who have failed initial therapy.",

This combination provides broad coverage for both typical and atypical pathogens. Macrolide or doxycycline monotherapy is generally insufficient for moderate to severe inpatient CAP.",

Other risk factors include recent hospitalization, prior antibiotic use, and severe underlying immunocompromise. Recognizing these risk factors guides the choice of broader-spectrum antibiotics.",

Key criteria include: temperature <37.8°C, heart rate <100 bpm, respiratory rate <24 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure >90 mmHg, oxygen saturation >90% on room air, and ability to maintain oral intake and normal mental status.
