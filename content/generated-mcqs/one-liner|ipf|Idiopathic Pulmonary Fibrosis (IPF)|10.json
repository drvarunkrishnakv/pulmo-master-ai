    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "ipf",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The diagnosis of IPF relies heavily on the presence of a Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) pattern on HRCT, either definite or probable, in the absence of an identifiable cause. A definite UIP pattern on HRCT includes basal and peripheral predominant reticulation, honeycomb changes, and traction bronchiectasis, with no features atypical for UIP (e.g., extensive ground-glass, mosaic attenuation, predominant upper/mid-lung distribution).",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "ipf",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Histologically, IPF is defined by a UIP pattern, characterized by temporal and spatial heterogeneity. This includes areas of dense fibrosis with architectural distortion (honeycombing), foci of proliferating fibroblasts (fibroblastic foci), and normal lung tissue. Inflammation is typically mild and patchy.",

Its mechanism involves reducing fibroblast proliferation, inhibiting the production of profibrotic mediators like TGF-β and TNF-α, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical trials have shown it slows the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC).",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "ipf",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Nintedanib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets multiple receptors. Its antifibrotic action in IPF is primarily mediated through the inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRα/β), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1-3), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1-3). These receptors are crucial in pathways leading to fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix deposition.",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "Myofibroblasts are key effector cells in the pathogenesis of IPF. They are derived from various sources, including resident fibroblasts, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of epithelial cells, and circulating fibrocytes. Myofibroblasts produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix components (collagen, fibronectin) and contribute to tissue contraction, leading to the progressive scarring characteristic of IPF.",

It is defined as a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause, limited to the lungs, and associated with the radiological and/or histological pattern of Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP).

Mutations in genes encoding telomerase components, such as TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) and TERC (telomerase RNA component), are the most common genetic abnormalities identified in FPF.
