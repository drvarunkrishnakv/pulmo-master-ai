    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "bal",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Sarcoidosis typically presents with a lymphocytic alveolitis, often with a CD4/CD8 ratio greater than 3.5, and sometimes even as high as 10. This ratio is a key diagnostic clue, differentiating it from other lymphocytic interstitial lung diseases like hypersensitivity pneumonitis, where the ratio is usually normal or inverted (CD8 predominant).",
    "highYieldPearl": "A BAL CD4/CD8 ratio >3.5 is highly suggestive of sarcoidosis, while a ratio <1 is often seen in hypersensitivity pneumonitis or HIV-related lung diseases.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis also causes lymphocytic alveolitis, but usually with a normal or low CD4/CD8 ratio. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis typically shows neutrophilic predominance. Drug-induced lung disease can have varied BAL findings, including lymphocytosis, but a specific CD4/CD8 ratio is not as characteristic as in sarcoidosis.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "bal",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in patients unable to produce sputum. Its sensitivity ranges from 90% to 99%, making it highly effective for direct visualization of the organism using stains like Giemsa, Gomori methenamine silver (GMS), or immunofluorescence.",
    "highYieldPearl": "BAL is highly sensitive for PCP diagnosis, especially in immunocompromised patients, surpassing induced sputum in diagnostic yield.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Sputum induction has lower sensitivity (50-90%) for PCP. Knowing the high diagnostic yield of BAL for PCP is crucial for patient management, particularly in HIV/AIDS patients.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "bal",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "In Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), bronchoalveolar lavage often reveals a predominant neutrophilia (typically >10%), sometimes accompanied by eosinophilia. This neutrophilic inflammation is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, although BAL is not diagnostic for IPF but can help exclude other conditions.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Neutrophilic alveolitis in BAL is a common finding in IPF, distinguishing it from conditions like sarcoidosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis which show lymphocytosis.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Lymphocytosis is characteristic of sarcoidosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Eosinophilia is seen in eosinophilic pneumonias or drug reactions. While IPF is a diagnosis of exclusion, BAL findings of neutrophilia are consistent with the disease process.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "bal",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "ARDS is a clinical diagnosis. BAL is not used for routine diagnosis or therapeutic lavage in ARDS. Its primary role in the context of ARDS is to exclude treatable causes of lung injury, particularly bacterial, fungal, or viral infections, which can mimic ARDS or complicate its course. It helps guide antimicrobial therapy.",

    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "ARDS is diagnosed clinically based on specific criteria (Berlin definition). Therapeutic lavage is not standard practice for ARDS. While BAL fluid can contain inflammatory markers, it's not a primary tool for prognostic assessment in ARDS.",

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in PAP is typically milky or turbid due to this material, which stains positive with Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. This finding is highly characteristic and often diagnostic.",
