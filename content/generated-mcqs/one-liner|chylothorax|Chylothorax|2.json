    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "chylothorax",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Chylothorax is the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space due to disruption of the thoracic duct. The diagnosis is confirmed by pleural fluid analysis showing a triglyceride level greater than 110 mg/dL (or 1.24 mmol/L). If triglyceride levels are between 50-110 mg/dL, lipoprotein electrophoresis to detect chylomicrons is required for definitive diagnosis. Pseudochylothorax, often seen in chronic effusions (e.g., rheumatoid pleurisy, tuberculosis), is characterized by high cholesterol levels (>200 mg/dL) and the absence of chylomicrons.",
    "highYieldPearl": "The presence of chylomicrons on lipoprotein electrophoresis is the most definitive test for chylothorax, especially when triglyceride levels are borderline.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Pseudochylothorax is a common distractor due to its milky appearance, but it's differentiated by high cholesterol and absence of chylomicrons. Empyema is purulent, and malignant effusion is diagnosed by cytology.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "chylothorax",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The thoracic duct is vulnerable to injury during various cardiothoracic and neck surgeries. Esophagectomy, particularly during dissection in the posterior mediastinum, carries the highest risk of thoracic duct injury, leading to chylothorax. Other high-risk procedures include mediastinal tumor resection, lung transplantation, and cardiac surgery.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Non-iatrogenic causes of chylothorax include malignancy (especially lymphoma), trauma, and congenital anomalies of the thoracic duct.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "While other procedures involve the chest, esophagectomy involves extensive dissection directly in the vicinity of the thoracic duct, making it the most frequent iatrogenic cause. Lung biopsy, thoracentesis, and bronchoscopy typically do not involve the deep mediastinal structures where the thoracic duct lies.",
