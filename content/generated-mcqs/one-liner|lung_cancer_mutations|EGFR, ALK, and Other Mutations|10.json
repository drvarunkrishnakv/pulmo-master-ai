    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lung_cancer_mutations",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Activating EGFR mutations, primarily exon 19 deletions and L858R point mutations in exon 21, define a distinct subset of NSCLC that is highly sensitive to EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs). First-generation (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib), second-generation (e.g., afatinib, dacomitinib), and third-generation (osimertinib) EGFR TKIs are standard first-line therapies, with osimertinib currently preferred due to superior efficacy and CNS penetration.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Osimertinib is now the preferred first-line EGFR TKI for common EGFR mutations due to improved progression-free and overall survival, and better CNS activity.",

    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Candidates might be tempted by immunotherapy, but for oncogene-driven NSCLC, targeted therapy is superior to immunotherapy or chemotherapy as first-line. ALK inhibitors are for ALK rearrangements, not EGFR mutations.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "lung_cancer_mutations",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The EGFR T790M mutation, located in exon 20, is the most common acquired resistance mechanism (approximately 50-60% of cases) to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs. This 'gatekeeper' mutation increases ATP affinity, reducing the effectiveness of these inhibitors. Third-generation EGFR TKIs like osimertinib were specifically designed to overcome T790M.",

NGS can detect a broader range of fusion partners and is becoming the preferred method in many centers.",
