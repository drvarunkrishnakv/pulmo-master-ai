    "question": "Bronchial thermoplasty reduces airway smooth muscle mass by delivering controlled thermal energy to which airway layers?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Mucosa and submucosa",
      "B": "Submucosa and smooth muscle",
      "C": "Smooth muscle and cartilage",
      "D": "Mucosa and adventitia"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "interventional_bronch",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a bronchoscopic procedure for severe refractory asthma. It involves delivering controlled thermal energy (radiofrequency ablation) to the airway walls. The energy passes through the submucosa to target and reduce the amount of airway smooth muscle, leading to decreased bronchoconstriction and improved asthma control.",
    "highYieldPearl": "BT specifically targets the smooth muscle layer to reduce its mass and contractility, thereby reducing bronchospasm.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "The trap lies in confusing the layers. While the energy is delivered to the airway wall, its primary therapeutic effect is on the smooth muscle, which necessitates it passing through the submucosa.",

    "question": "For definitive mediastinal lymph node staging in lung cancer, which interventional bronchoscopic technique is considered gold standard?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Radial EBUS",
      "B": "Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)",
      "C": "Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB)",
      "D": "Autofluorescence bronchoscopy"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "interventional_bronch",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "EBUS-TBNA allows for real-time visualization of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and subsequent sampling with a needle. It has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing and staging lung cancer, making it the preferred and gold standard method for minimally invasive mediastinal lymph node staging.",
    "highYieldPearl": "EBUS-TBNA is the gold standard for mediastinal lymph node staging due to its high diagnostic yield and minimal invasiveness.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Other options like Radial EBUS and ENB are used for peripheral lesion diagnosis, while autofluorescence bronchoscopy is for mucosal lesion detection. None are gold standards for mediastinal lymph node staging.",

    "question": "A key contraindication for endobronchial valve placement in severe emphysema is absence of which anatomical feature?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Collateral ventilation",
      "B": "Bronchiectasis",
      "C": "Significant cardiac comorbidity",
      "D": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "interventional_bronch",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Endobronchial valves aim to achieve atelectasis of the target hyperinflated lobe by preventing air entry during inspiration and allowing air exit during expiration. The presence of collateral ventilation (interlobar air movement through Kohn's pores or Lambert's canals) between the target lobe and adjacent lobes prevents complete collapse of the target lobe, rendering the valves ineffective. Assessment for collateral ventilation (e.g., using Chartis system) is crucial.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Collateral ventilation is the most critical anatomical contraindication for successful endobronchial valve placement.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "While significant cardiac comorbidity might be a general contraindication for any invasive procedure, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an etiology of emphysema, the absence of collateral ventilation is a specific anatomical/physiological contraindication directly impacting the efficacy of endobronchial valves.",

      "C": "Significant airway obstruction due to intrinsic or extrinsic compression",
      "D": "Localized hemoptysis"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "interventional_bronch",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Endobronchial stents are primarily used to maintain airway patency in cases of significant airway obstruction. This obstruction can be due to intrinsic lesions (e.g., endobronchial tumors, granulomas, scar tissue) or extrinsic compression (e.g., mediastinal tumors, lymphadenopathy, vascular anomalies). They help relieve dyspnea and prevent atelectasis.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Airway stenting is crucial for restoring and maintaining patency in compromised airways, whether from internal or external forces.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Chronic cough, airway hyperresponsiveness, and localized hemoptysis are not primary indications for stent placement. Stents are for structural support against collapse or narrowing.",

    "question": "Which advantage is unique to rigid bronchoscopy compared to flexible bronchoscopy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ability to access peripheral airways",
      "B": "Superior ventilation control during intervention",
      "C": "Outpatient procedure capability",
      "D": "Lower risk of pneumothorax"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "interventional_bronch",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Rigid bronchoscopy offers several advantages, including a larger working channel for therapeutic interventions (e.g., foreign body removal, debulking tumors, stenting), better suctioning capability, and crucially, the ability to maintain a secure airway and provide superior ventilation control (e.g., jet ventilation) during complex procedures or in cases of severe airway obstruction. This allows for better management of acute respiratory compromise during intervention.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rigid bronchoscope provides an open airway for ventilation and allows for larger instruments, making it ideal for therapeutic interventions requiring significant control.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Flexible bronchoscopy is superior for accessing peripheral airways. Both can be done as outpatient procedures (though rigid often requires general anesthesia and a more controlled setting). The risk of pneumothorax depends more on the specific intervention than the scope type itself, although rigid bronchoscopy carries its own set of risks related to airway manipulation.",
