This is the most appropriate initial diagnostic/management step.",

While optimization is key, increasing the ICS dose further without first evaluating and correcting fundamental issues like inhaler technique or managing comorbidities may be ineffective and is not the *most appropriate initial step* for classification as per the given context."

Despite this regimen, he reports worsening fatigue, migratory arthralgias, and new-onset numbness and tingling in his lower extremities. Physical examination reveals palpable purpura on his shins.

EGPA is a systemic vasculitis that often presents with severe asthma and eosinophilia. The new neurological symptoms (paresthesias) and skin lesions (purpura) are classic extrathoracic manifestations. ANCA testing (specifically p-ANCA/MPO-ANCA) is a crucial diagnostic step for EGPA, and tissue biopsy (e.g., nerve, skin, lung) can confirm vasculitic changes and eosinophilic infiltration.",
