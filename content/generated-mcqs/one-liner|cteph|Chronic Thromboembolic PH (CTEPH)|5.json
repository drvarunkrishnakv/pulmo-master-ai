    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "cteph",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Conventional pulmonary angiography provides the highest resolution imaging of the pulmonary arterial tree, allowing direct visualization of organized thrombi, webs, bands, and stenoses characteristic of CTEPH, which is crucial for surgical planning. While V/Q scan screens, CTPA can show thrombi, and RHC confirms PH, none are the 'gold standard' for definitive diagnosis and operability assessment like conventional angiography.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Conventional pulmonary angiography is essential for confirming the diagnosis of CTEPH and assessing the extent and accessibility of the disease for pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA).",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "cteph",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Pulmonary Endarterectomy (PEA) is the only potentially curative treatment for CTEPH. It involves surgical removal of organized thrombi and fibrotic material from the pulmonary arteries. It is reserved for patients with surgically accessible disease and is performed by highly specialized centers.",
    "highYieldPearl": "PEA is the gold standard treatment for operable CTEPH, offering significant hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement, and often a cure.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Students might consider other options like Riociguat (medical therapy) or BPA (for inoperable/residual disease) as definitive treatments, but PEA stands out for its curative potential in operable cases.",

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "cteph",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, is the only medication specifically approved for the treatment of inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent PH after pulmonary endarterectomy. While other PH-specific therapies (like sildenafil, bosentan, treprostinil) might be used off-label, Riociguat has specific approval.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Riociguat is the first and only drug specifically approved for CTEPH patients who are not candidates for PEA or have persistent/recurrent PH after surgery.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "All listed options are PH-specific drugs. The key is 'specifically approved' for CTEPH, which points to Riociguat due to its unique mechanism and trial data in this specific population.",

    "question": "The primary cause of persistent obstruction in Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension is organized thrombi in which vessels?",

      "A": "Pulmonary arterioles",
      "B": "Pulmonary capillaries",
      "C": "Distal pulmonary arteries",
      "D": "Proximal pulmonary arteries"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "topic": "cteph",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "CTEPH is characterized by the failure of acute pulmonary emboli to resolve, leading to organization and fibrosis of thrombi within the proximal pulmonary arteries. This chronic obstruction then leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and subsequent microvascular remodeling in the distal pulmonary circulation.",
    "highYieldPearl": "The hallmark of CTEPH is organized, fibrotic thrombi in the elastic pulmonary arteries (proximal), unlike other forms of PH primarily affecting arterioles.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Students might be misled by the 'microvascular remodeling' aspect of PH, but the initiating and primary obstructive lesion in CTEPH is the organized thrombus in the larger, more proximal pulmonary arteries.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "cteph",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "A Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) scan is the most sensitive and recommended initial screening test for CTEPH. A normal V/Q scan essentially rules out CTEPH (high negative predictive value). While echocardiography can suggest PH, and CTPA can show thrombi, V/Q scan's high sensitivity for perfusion defects makes it ideal for screening.",
    "highYieldPearl": "A normal V/Q scan makes CTEPH highly unlikely; it is the most sensitive screening test for CTEPH.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "trapAnalysis": "Students might confuse the initial 'screening' test with definitive diagnostic tests (like RHC or conventional angiography) or other imaging modalities.",
