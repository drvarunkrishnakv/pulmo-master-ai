    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "cxr",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The silhouette sign occurs when two objects of the same radiographic density are in direct contact, obscuring their common border. On CXR, if a pulmonary opacity is contiguous with the heart border or diaphragm, their interface is lost, indicating the opacity is in the same anatomical plane (e.g., right middle lobe pneumonia silhouetting the right heart border).",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "Air bronchograms are visible branching lucencies within an area of consolidated lung. They occur when alveoli are filled with fluid (pus, blood, edema, cells) but the bronchi remain air-filled and patent. This sign is highly suggestive of an alveolar filling process (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, non-obstructive atelectasis).",

    "deepDiveExplanation": "In a healthy erect individual, hydrostatic pressure causes greater blood flow to the lung bases. Cephalization, or upper lobe diversion, describes the redistribution of blood flow to the upper lung zones, making their vascular markings more prominent than the lower zones. This is an early sign of increased pulmonary venous pressure, most commonly due to left ventricular failure (early pulmonary edema) or mitral stenosis.",
