Simultaneously, a high-altitude mountaineer is acclimatizing at 16,000 feet, where the ambient atmospheric pressure is approximately 0.5 ATA. Both individuals are at a steady physiological state. Assuming normal compensatory mechanisms for each environment, which of the following statements most accurately compares their alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO₂)?",

      "A": "The diver's PAO₂ is significantly higher than the climber's PAO₂, even with the climber's compensatory hyperventilation.",
      "B": "The climber's PAO₂ is significantly higher than the diver's PAO₂ due to profound hyperventilation, despite the lower ambient PO₂.",

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "Altitude and Diving Medicine",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "To determine the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO₂) for both individuals, we use the alveolar gas equation (PAO₂ = PIO₂ - PaCO₂/R, where PIO₂ = FIO₂ x (P_ambient - P_H₂O)).\n1.  **Diver at 33 fsw:** From Figure 107.2, 33 fsw corresponds to approximately 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA). The inspired partial pressure of oxygen (PIO₂) at 2 ATA, breathing 21% oxygen, is 0.21 x 2 ATA = 0.42 ATA. Converting to mmHg: 0.42 ATA x 760 mmHg/ATA = 319.2 mmHg. The table's 'PAO₂*' value for 33 fsw (2 ATA) is 269 mmHg, assuming a PaCO₂ of 40 mmHg. This is the actual PAO₂ for the diver.\n2.  **Climber at 16,000 feet:** The ambient atmospheric pressure is 0.5 ATA (0.5 x 760 mmHg = 380 mmHg). The inspired partial pressure of oxygen (PIO₂) is 0.21 x 380 mmHg = 79.8 mmHg. The critical note in Figure 107.2 states that at high altitude, climbers demonstrate profound hyperventilation, often reducing arterial PCO₂ to < 10 mmHg. If we assume a PaCO₂ of 10 mmHg (and a respiratory quotient R = 0.8), then PAO₂ = PIO₂ - PaCO₂/R = 79.8 - 10/0.8 = 79.8 - 12.5 = 67.3 mmHg.\n\nComparing the two: Diver's PAO₂ ≈ 269 mmHg vs. Climber's PAO₂ ≈ 67.3 mmHg. The diver's PAO₂ is significantly higher. While hyperventilation does elevate the climber's PAO₂ compared to what it would be with a normal PaCO₂, it cannot overcome the profound difference in ambient pressure (2 ATA vs 0.5 ATA).",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rio's Take: Always consider the significant impact of hyperventilation on alveolar PO₂ at high altitude. While it ameliorates hypoxia, it rarely matches the PAO₂ achievable at depth, even at relatively shallow depths like 33 fsw.

      "B": "Incorrect. This option overemphasizes the effect of hyperventilation. While hyperventilation significantly increases the climber's PAO₂ relative to a sedentary state, it cannot elevate it to levels comparable to or higher than breathing air at 2 ATA.",
      "C": "Incorrect. A PAO₂ of 269 mmHg for the diver is well within normal limits and not dangerous. A PAO₂ of ~67 mmHg at altitude, while low by sea-level standards, is a physiological adaptation that allows for survival and activity, though performance may be impaired. It is not necessarily 'dangerously low' in the context of acclimatization.",
      "D": "Incorrect. The pressure differences are substantial (2 ATA vs 0.5 ATA), leading to vastly different PIO₂ values. Physiological mechanisms like hyperventilation help mitigate the hypoxia at altitude but do not equalize the PAO₂ between such disparate environments."

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "Altitude and Diving Medicine",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "1.  **Saturation Decompression:** The text states, 'Once saturation is reached, the decompression time (which may last days or weeks) is the same for any duration of dive.' This directly refutes option A. The body's tissues have absorbed the maximum amount of inert gas possible at that depth, and further time at depth does not increase the gas load, thus not increasing the required decompression time.\n2.  **Oxygen Toxicity:** The risk of oxygen toxicity depends on both partial pressure and duration. While saturation divers are continuously exposed to elevated PO₂, the breathing mixtures are carefully managed to keep the PO₂ below levels that would cause acute CNS toxicity (e.g., typically below 1.3-1.4 ATA for work, and lower for living). Prolonged exposure to even moderately elevated PO₂ (e.g., 0.5-0.7 ATA) can lead to pulmonary oxygen toxicity (manifesting as tracheobronchial irritation, decreased vital capacity) over days to weeks. Acute CNS oxygen toxicity (seizures, visual disturbances, vertigo) is associated with higher partial pressures (e.g., >1.6 ATA) and/or exertion, and is more typically a risk during shorter, higher-intensity exposures or excursions rather than continuous living within the habitat if PO₂ is well-controlled. Therefore, stating CNS toxicity is the 'primary risk' during their *time within the habitat* (implying prolonged steady state) is inaccurate if PO2 is managed.\n3.  **Rapid Depressurization at Depth:** A sudden loss of pressure at depth (i.e., the habitat itself fails) means the ambient pressure around the diver drops precipitously while they are still surrounded by high-pressure water. This is equivalent to an uncontrolled, extremely rapid ascent from a saturated state, which would cause massive inert gas bubble formation and severe, often fatal, decompression sickness. This is a critical risk in saturation diving operations.\n4.  **Helium vs. Nitrogen:** Helium is used in deep diving gas mixtures (heliox, trimix) precisely because it has a *lower* narcotic potency than nitrogen, significantly reducing the risk of nitrogen narcosis at depths where nitrogen would become debilitating. It also has lower density, reducing breathing resistance.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rio's Take: Saturation diving decouples dive duration from decompression time once saturation is achieved. A catastrophic depressurization at depth for a saturated diver is akin to a rapid, uncontrolled ascent from maximum inert gas load, leading to severe and rapid DCS. Remember that helium is preferred for deep dives due to its *lower* narcotic potency.",

While oxygen toxicity is a risk, continuous exposure within the habitat, if PO₂ is properly managed (usually below 0.7 ATA), is more associated with pulmonary oxygen toxicity over prolonged periods. Acute CNS oxygen toxicity is typically seen with higher PO₂ excursions or in cases of equipment malfunction.",
      "C": "Correct. A sudden depressurization of the habitat at depth would cause a massive, rapid release of inert gas from the saturated tissues into the bloodstream and tissues, leading to immediate and severe decompression sickness due to massive bubble formation.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "topic": "Altitude and Diving Medicine",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The clinical vignette points to a critical underlying cause based on specific findings:\n1.  **'Hookah dive' with improvised system:** The provided text explicitly mentions that 'improvised surface-supplied setups (i.e., hookah diving support systems) are often used by fishermen... These setups can expose divers to unsafe gas pressures or hazardous gases (e.g., compressed carbon monoxide from an air compressor intake placed near the…'. This establishes the strong possibility of gas contamination, particularly CO.\n2.  **Cherry-red discoloration:** This is a classic and highly characteristic sign of severe carbon monoxide poisoning. CO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity 200-250 times greater than oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), which has a distinctive bright red color, causing the cherry-red appearance of skin and mucous membranes. This is a crucial diagnostic clue that differentiates CO poisoning from other diving-related emergencies.\n3.  **Coma and Hypotension:** These are consistent with severe CO poisoning, leading to cellular hypoxia and cardiovascular collapse.\n4.  **Pulmonary findings (crackles, diminished breath sounds):** While these could be due to aspiration in a near-drowning scenario, they could also reflect non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS) which can occur in severe CO poisoning, or concurrent pulmonary barotrauma if the improvised system had unregulated pressure. However, the cherry-red skin points primarily to CO poisoning as the *systemic* and *primary* cause of the patient's critical state.\n\nConsidering the options:\n*   **A: Severe arterial gas embolism (AGE) secondary to pulmonary barotrauma.** While barotrauma and AGE can cause unconsciousness and can occur with rapid ascent or improper breathing during ascent (though not explicitly stated as rapid ascent here), AGE does not cause cherry-red skin. The depth of 25 feet is shallow, but barotrauma is still possible.\n*   **B: Carbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning from a contaminated air supply.** This is strongly supported by the 'hookah dive' context and the pathognomonic cherry-red discoloration, along with coma and hypotension.\n*   **C: Type II Decompression Sickness (DCS) with cerebral involvement.** DCS typically requires deeper or longer dives for significant inert gas loading and bubble formation upon ascent. A 25-foot dive for 45 minutes, while potentially creating some nitrogen loading, is less likely to cause such severe, immediate, and profound cerebral DCS as the *primary* cause compared to gas toxicity. Also, DCS does not cause cherry-red skin.\n*   **D: Near-drowning with aspiration pneumonitis and profound hypothermia.** While near-drowning could explain unconsciousness, pulmonary findings, and hypothermia is possible given the water exposure, none of these conditions cause cherry-red discoloration.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rio's Take: Always heed classic signs! Cherry-red skin in an unconscious patient with suspected gas exposure (especially from improvised systems like hookah diving) is highly suggestive of severe carbon monoxide poisoning.

      "D": "Plausible, as immersion can lead to near-drowning and hypothermia, which can cause unconsciousness and pulmonary issues.

Considering the physiological adaptations and the pressure equivalents provided, which of the following statements most accurately reflects their alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2)?",

      "C": "Both individuals would experience significantly reduced PAO2 due to the combined effects of inert gas partial pressure at depth and markedly decreased ambient pressure at altitude.",
      "D": "The diver's PAO2 would be around 429 mmHg, while the mountaineer's PAO2, despite physiological hyperventilation, would remain critically low, approximately 16.8 mmHg, barely sustaining life."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "Altitude and Diving Medicine",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "At 66 feet of seawater (fsw), the total ambient pressure is 3 ATA. Breathing 21% oxygen, the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in the inspired air (PIO2) is significantly elevated (0.21 * (3 * 760 - 47) ≈ 462 mmHg, assuming typical body temperature water vapor pressure). The table explicitly states a hypothetical PAO2* of 429 mmHg for a diver at 66 fsw (3 ATA) breathing 21% O2 (assuming PaCO2=40 mmHg and ambient temp 15°C). For the mountaineer at 20,000 feet, the ambient pressure is 0.419 ATA (318 mmHg). The hypothetical PAO2* for a person breathing 21% O2 at this altitude with a PaCO2 of 40 mmHg is 16.8 mmHg. However, the text specifically notes that high-altitude climbers demonstrate profound hyperventilation, driving arterial PCO2 to less than 10 mmHg. Using the alveolar gas equation (PAO2 = PIO2 - PaCO2/R), if PaCO2 drops to 10 mmHg, the mountaineer's PIO2 at 20,000 ft (0.21 * (318 - ~12.8 mmHg at 15°C) ≈ 64 mmHg) would result in a PAO2 of roughly 64 - 10/0.8 = 51.5 mmHg. While this is significantly higher than the 16.8 mmHg hypothetical value, it is still drastically lower than the diver's 429 mmHg. Therefore, the diver maintains a much higher PAO2.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rio's Take: The profound hyperventilation at high altitude, while crucial for raising alveolar PO2 from critically low levels, cannot compensate for the fundamental difference in ambient atmospheric pressure and inspired PO2 experienced by a diver at depth. Always consider both absolute pressure and physiological adaptations.",

      "A": "This option correctly identifies the higher PAO2 in the diver and appropriately acknowledges the increase in the mountaineer's PAO2 due to hyperventilation, while still maintaining the significant difference. It requires understanding both the quantitative effect of depth/pressure and the qualitative/quantitative effect of hyperventilation.",
      "B": "This is a trap that overestimates the compensatory effect of hyperventilation. While hyperventilation significantly raises the mountaineer's PAO2, it does not bring it into a range comparable to the partial pressures experienced at 3 ATA (66 fsw).",
      "C": "This is incorrect because the diver experiences a *higher* PAO2 due to increased ambient pressure, not a reduced one. Inert gas partial pressure affects decompression sickness but not directly the PAO2 in this context unless referring to gas mixtures with lower FIO2.",
      "D": "This option correctly states the diver's PAO2 but incorrectly implies that hyperventilation does not significantly alter the mountaineer's PAO2 from the hypothetical 16.8 mmHg value.

The living habitat remains pressurized at the working depth to allow divers to move between the habitat and the work site without incurring decompression penalties. Frequent ascents to the surface between shifts (as described in option D) would defeat the entire purpose of saturation diving, as each ascent would necessitate a complete decompression profile or lead to severe decompression sickness. Such ascents are precisely what saturation diving is designed to avoid, allowing divers to 'delay their decompression' until the very end of their work period.

    "deepDiveExplanation": "The context highlights that 'improvised surface-supplied setups (i.e., hookah diving support systems)... can expose divers to unsafe gas pressures or hazardous gases (e.g., compressed carbon monoxide from an air compressor intake placed near the...)' The scenario directly provides this risk factor: the compressor intake is near the boat's exhaust, a known source of carbon monoxide (CO).\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Nitrogen narcosis typically causes impaired judgment and euphoria, usually manifesting at depths greater than 100 fsw (30 meters). While 60 fsw can induce mild narcosis in some, the symptoms (headache, nausea, disorientation *after resurfacing*) are more suggestive of a toxic gas or decompression illness, rather than narcosis which typically resolves quickly on ascent.\nB. The diver is breathing ambient air (21% O₂) at 60 fsw. At 60 fsw, the absolute pressure is approximately 2.8 ATA (since 33 fsw = 2 ATA and 66 fsw = 3 ATA). The partial pressure of oxygen (PO₂) would be 0.21 * 2.8 ATA = 0.588 ATA. This is well below the common threshold for CNS oxygen toxicity (1.4-1.6 ATA for recreational/commercial diving). So, acute oxygen toxicity is unlikely.\nC. Carbon monoxide (CO) from the boat's exhaust, if drawn into the compressor, would be delivered to the diver. CO poisoning symptoms include headache, nausea, and disorientation. Crucially, the toxicity of CO is significantly enhanced at elevated ambient pressures (depth) because the partial pressure of CO increases, leading to more rapid and extensive formation of carboxyhemoglobin, even with small concentrations of CO at the surface. The symptoms appearing shortly after resurfacing are consistent with delayed presentation of CO poisoning or symptoms persisting after ascent from depth. This is the most direct and highly likely explanation given the specific hazard mentioned in the context and scenario.\nD. Decompression sickness (DCS) can cause neurological symptoms including disorientation and headache. However, a single 60-foot dive is often within no-decompression limits for recreational diving, depending on duration (usually allows for 50-60 minutes at 60 fsw). While 'rapid ascent' is not explicitly stated, 'shortly after resurfacing' could suggest DCS. However, given the explicit description of the compressor intake being near the exhaust, CO poisoning becomes the *most likely* specific cause.",

      "C": "This is the correct answer. It directly links the specific hazard mentioned in the context (CO from compressor intake near exhaust) with the diver's symptoms and the physiological enhancement of CO toxicity at depth. It requires integrating scenario details with diving physiology.",
      "D": "Decompression sickness is a common concern in diving and can present with neurological symptoms. However, 60 fsw is generally not a 'deep' dive, and without specific details about dive duration or ascent rate, it's less *likely* than the explicitly described gas contamination risk.

His dive depth was approximately 40 feet. On examination, he is confused, tachycardic, and his skin appears flushed. Arterial blood gas shows pH 7.30, PaCO2 48 mmHg, PaO2 120 mmHg on room air. A pulse oximeter reads 98%. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of his symptoms?",

The provided text explicitly mentions that 'improvised surface-supplied setups...can expose divers to unsafe gas pressures or hazardous gases (e.g., compressed carbon monoxide from an air compressor intake placed near the...).' CO poisoning is notorious for causing symptoms that mimic other conditions and for misleading diagnostic parameters. Specifically, the normal to high PaO2 on ABG and high pulse oximetry reading (98%) are classic pitfalls, as pulse oximeters cannot differentiate between oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, thus giving falsely reassuring oxygen saturation readings while tissue hypoxia is profound.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rio's Take: In CO poisoning, classic symptoms (headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion) coupled with a normal pulse oximetry reading are a red flag.

Also, the ABG/SpO2 findings are not indicative of DCS.",
      "C": "Arterial gas embolism (AGE) is a serious diving injury usually resulting from rapid ascent and presents with dramatic, acute neurological symptoms (e.g., immediate loss of consciousness, stroke-like symptoms, seizures) often occurring immediately or very shortly after surfacing. The more gradual onset of headache, dizziness, and nausea in this case makes AGE less likely.",
      "D": "Nitrogen narcosis ('rapture of the deep') occurs at depth due to the intoxicating effect of nitrogen under pressure, typically at depths greater than 100 fsw, though it can begin around 60 fsw. The symptoms (impaired judgment, euphoria, disorientation) resolve quickly upon ascending to shallower depths. Since the diver has surfaced and his symptoms persist, nitrogen narcosis is not the cause."

    "deepDiveExplanation": "The text clearly states, 'Once saturation is reached, the decompression time (which may last days or weeks) is the same for any duration of dive.' This is a defining characteristic of saturation diving. Saturation occurs when the body's tissues have absorbed the maximum amount of inert gas possible for a given depth, meaning further time at that depth does not increase the 'gas burden' that needs to be decompressed. Therefore, the decompression schedule is determined by the depth and the initial saturation, not by the extended duration of the saturation itself.",

The symptoms of severe headache, nausea, and disorientation are classic manifestations of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. This can occur if the compressor intake for the hookah system is placed too close to combustion exhausts (e.g., from the boat engine). CO readily binds to hemoglobin, forming carboxyhemoglobin, impairing oxygen transport and utilization, leading to cellular hypoxia, particularly affecting the brain.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rio's Take: Always consider CO poisoning in divers using improvised or surface-supplied systems, especially if the air source is near combustion exhausts, even for shallow, short dives. Its symptoms mimic many diving emergencies but often present with a distinct history.",

      "A": "Correct. Directly aligned with the risk described for improvised hookah systems (compressor near exhaust) and classic CO poisoning symptoms (headache, nausea, disorientation).",
      "B": "Less likely. Decompression sickness (DCS) typically requires deeper or longer dives, or rapid ascent from significant depth, allowing inert gas bubbles to form. A 30-minute dive to 15 feet (very shallow) is generally well within no-decompression limits for air diving, making DCS unlikely unless there was an unusual ascent profile not mentioned.",
      "C": "Unlikely. Central nervous system (CNS) oxygen toxicity usually occurs with exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen (PO2), typically in deeper dives (e.g., >60-90 fsw on air) or when breathing enriched oxygen mixtures, for a longer duration. A 15-foot dive on ambient air would not result in a sufficiently high PO2 to cause CNS oxygen toxicity.",
      "D": "Possible if there was rapid ascent and breath-holding, but the primary symptoms (severe headache, nausea, disorientation) are not typical for pulmonary barotrauma (which usually involves chest pain, dyspnea, pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema). While cerebral arterial gas embolism (AGE) could cause confusion, the direct link to improvised setup and implied exhaust fumes strongly points to CO toxicity."

    "question": "A 50-year-old experienced commercial diver is preparing for a complex underwater construction project that is anticipated to last for 3 weeks at a depth requiring saturation diving. His primary concern is minimizing the total time spent decompressing after the project. Based on the principles of saturation diving, which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding his decompression planning?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The total decompression time will be the same regardless of whether he stays at depth for 2 weeks or 3 weeks.",
      "B": "Decompression time will be proportional to the total time spent at saturation depth.",
      "C": "To minimize decompression time, he should plan for shorter, intermittent periods at depth with surface intervals.",
      "D": "His living habitat must remain at depth for the entire duration of the 3-week project to achieve saturation."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "topic": "Altitude and Diving Medicine",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "The core principle of saturation diving, as stated in the text, is that 'Once saturation is reached, the decompression time (which may last days or weeks) is the same for any duration of dive.' Saturation refers to a steady state where the diver is no longer increasing absorption of inert gas. After reaching this steady state (which typically occurs within a few days), staying at depth for an additional week or two (e.g., from 2 weeks to 3 weeks) does not increase the inert gas load further, and therefore does not prolong the required decompression period.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Rio's Take: The defining feature of saturation diving is the independence of decompression time from the dive duration, once saturation is achieved. This allows for extremely long working periods at depth with a single, extended decompression schedule at the end.",

    "trapAnalysis": {
      "A": "This statement is correct and directly reflects the definition and principle of saturation diving provided in the text. Once saturation is reached, the body tissues are fully saturated with inert gas, and extending the time at depth does not increase the decompression obligation.",
      "B": "This statement is incorrect. It describes a characteristic of non-saturation diving. The entire purpose and advantage of saturation diving is that decompression time is *not* proportional to the total time spent at saturation depth once the saturation point is reached.",
      "C": "This statement is incorrect. Planning for shorter, intermittent periods with surface intervals would be a strategy to *avoid* saturation diving, leading to multiple decompression requirements or potentially a longer cumulative decompression time if significant work is to be done. Saturation diving is chosen for prolonged, continuous work at depth specifically because it optimizes decompression for such scenarios.",
      "D": "This statement is incorrect. The text says: 'In between working excursions, the living habitat may remain at depth or be transported to the surface; in either scenario, the habitat remains compressed at the working-depth pressure.' The crucial point is maintaining the working-depth pressure, not necessarily remaining physically at depth."

The symptoms of headache, dizziness, confusion, and fatigue are highly suggestive of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. The crucial detail is the normal oxygen saturation despite severe symptoms. CO binds to hemoglobin with a much higher affinity than oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). Pulse oximeters often cannot differentiate between oxyhemoglobin and COHb, leading to a falsely normal or near-normal SpO2 reading. The shared compressor and similar symptoms in the dive buddy further support a common gas-related exposure.",

While 40 fsw isn't extremely deep, if breathing 100% O2, it could occur. However, the symptoms are often convulsive, and given the context of an 'improvised hookah system' and shared compressor, a contaminant like CO is a more direct and common risk for these specific symptoms."

The text states, 'Relatively small changes in depth cause large changes in pressure, whereas extremely large changes in altitude are required for significant pressure changes. For example, descending from sea level to 33 feet of seawater (fsw) doubles the pressure'. This implies that ascending from 40 fsw (which is close to 33 fsw) halves the pressure, causing gas within the lungs to rapidly expand. Despite attempting to exhale, trapped air (due to mucus plugs, bronchospasm, or even normal airway closure) can lead to overexpansion of lung tissue. This results in pulmonary barotrauma, specifically alveolar rupture. The sudden pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and subcutaneous emphysema are classic signs of pneumomediastinum and potentially pneumothorax, all consequences of alveolar rupture.",

      "B": "Arterial gas embolism (AGE) is a serious complication often resulting from pulmonary barotrauma, where air bubbles enter the pulmonary circulation and then systemic arterial circulation. While AGE can occur with alveolar rupture, the primary pathophysiological event causing the *local* symptoms of chest pain, SOB, and subcutaneous emphysema is the alveolar rupture itself and the subsequent dissection of air. AGE would typically present more with immediate neurological deficits. Although it can coexist, alveolar rupture is the more direct explanation for the described localized signs.",
      "C": "Type II decompression sickness (DCS) involves neurological, cardiac, or respiratory manifestations, but it typically develops over minutes to hours after surfacing, not 'immediately' upon reaching the surface. The rapid onset and specific signs of subcutaneous emphysema strongly favor barotrauma over DCS.",
      "D": "Nitrogen narcosis occurs *at depth* due to increased partial pressure of nitrogen, causing impaired judgment and coordination. It resolves upon ascent. It does not cause chest pain, shortness of breath, or subcutaneous emphysema upon reaching the surface.

    "options": {
      "A": "Once saturation is achieved, the total time required for decompression at the end of the mission remains constant, regardless of how long the divers stay at depth.",
      "B": "It completely eliminates the need for decompression stops, allowing immediate ascent to the surface upon mission completion.",
      "C": "Divers can breathe normal atmospheric air, simplifying gas supply logistics and reducing costs.",

      "C": "Incorrect. Saturation divers breathe compressed gas mixtures (e.g., heliox) and live in pressurized habitats, not normal atmospheric air. The systems are complex and require sophisticated gas management.",
      "D": "Incorrect. Inert gas absorption reaches its maximum in saturation diving, but the risk of narcosis is related to the partial pressure of nitrogen (or other inert gases like helium in heliox). While helium is less narcotic than nitrogen, the statement is inaccurate about 'reduced due to continuous inert gas absorption.' The purpose is to reach a steady state, not to reduce narcosis in this context."
