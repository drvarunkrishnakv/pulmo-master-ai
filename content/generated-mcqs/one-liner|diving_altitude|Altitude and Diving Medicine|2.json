    "question": "Which medication primarily prevents High Altitude Pulmonary Edema by reducing pulmonary arterial pressure?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Acetazolamide",
      "B": "Dexamethasone",
      "C": "Nifedipine",
      "D": "Sildenafil"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "diving_altitude",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that reduces pulmonary arterial pressure, thereby preventing and treating High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE). It acts by blunting hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Sildenafil (D) is also a potent pulmonary vasodilator used for HAPE, but Nifedipine is a classic answer for its direct effect on PAP. Acetazolamide (A) is primarily used for AMS and HACE prevention/treatment by inducing metabolic acidosis and stimulating respiration. Dexamethasone (B) is used for AMS and HACE treatment/prevention due to its anti-inflammatory effects.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Nifedipine and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil) are the main pharmacological agents used to reduce pulmonary arterial pressure in HAPE.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "Candidates might confuse HAPE medications with those for AMS/HACE (Acetazolamide, Dexamethasone) or choose Sildenafil, which is also correct but Nifedipine is a frequently cited primary option.",

    "question": "The definitive treatment for arterial gas embolism (AGE) following a diving incident is?",
    "options": {
      "A": "100% normobaric oxygen",
      "B": "Intravenous fluid resuscitation",
      "C": "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy",
      "D": "Mechanical ventilation"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "topic": "diving_altitude",
    "deepDiveExplanation": "Arterial gas embolism (AGE) is a critical diving injury where gas bubbles enter the arterial circulation, often due to pulmonary barotrauma. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the definitive treatment. It works by: 1. Reducing bubble size (Boyle's Law). 2. Increasing the partial pressure gradient for nitrogen, promoting its washout from bubbles. 3. Providing supraphysiological oxygen levels to ischemic tissues. 100% normobaric oxygen (A) is initial first aid but not definitive. IV fluids (B) are supportive. Mechanical ventilation (D) may be needed for respiratory failure but does not address the emboli directly.",
    "highYieldPearl": "Any neurological symptom occurring immediately or shortly after a dive should be treated as AGE or severe Decompression Sickness, mandating immediate transfer for HBOT.",
    "examStyle": "NEET-SS",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "trapAnalysis": "The trap lies in confusing initial management (100% normobaric O2) with definitive treatment (HBOT). Other options are supportive or for complications, not the primary treatment for the embolism itself.",
