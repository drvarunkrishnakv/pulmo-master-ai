    "deepDiveExplanation": "Prone positioning redistributes ventilation and perfusion, recruiting previously collapsed dorsal lung regions, reducing shunt, and making ventilation more uniform, thus improving V/Q matching. While it reduces shunt, improving V/Q matching is a broader and more encompassing primary mechanism.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
