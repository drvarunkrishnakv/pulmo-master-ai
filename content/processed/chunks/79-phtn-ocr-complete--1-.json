Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction\nPatients with HFrEF or HFmrEF require guideline-directed treatment including established medical and interventional therapies.27\nIn patients with advanced HFrEF, implanting an LVAD may significantly reduce or even normalize mPAP,675 although this is not achieved in all patients,676 and an increased DPG emerged as a negative prognostic factor after LVAD implantation.677 With regards to PAH drugs, bosentan was assessed in an RCT of patients with PH associated with HFrEF,678 showing no efficacy but an increase in adverse events compared with placebo, predominantly related to fluid retention. Small studies have suggested that sildenafil may improve haemodynamics and exercise capacity in PH and HFrEF,679–681 but RCTs are lacking.\n\n\n\n## 8.3.1.2. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction\ntors were assessed in two small RCTs in patients with HFpEF and PH with distinct haemodynamic characteristics. In patients with a predominantly IpcPH profile, sildenafil had no effect on mPAP (primary endpoint) or other haemodynamic and clinical measures vs. placebo.685 In patients with a predominantly CpcPH profile, sildenafil improved haemodynamics, RV function, and quality of life at 6 and 12 months vs. placebo.686 Furthermore, retrospective analyses and registry data suggested improvements in exercise capacity with PDE5i therapy in patients with HFpEF-associated CpcPH and with a severe pre-capillary component (PVR mostly >5 WU).450,687\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 43 -->",
