The Time Controlled Adaptive Ventilation (TCAV™) method of setting the APRV mode includes the following settings: 1) upper airway pressure ($P_{High}$); 2) lower airway pressure ($P_{Low}$); 3) time spent at $P_{High}$ ($T_{High}$); and 4) time spent at $P_{Low}$ ($T_{Low}$). Combined, $P_{High}$ and $T_{High}$ form the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) Phase and impact end-inspiratory lung volume. The CPAP Phase releases to the combined $P_{Low}$ and $T_{Low}$, which form the Release Phase and impact end-expiratory lung volume. During the TCAV™ method of APRV, the ventilator cycles between the CPAP and Release Phases. During the release phase, the $T_{Low}$ set to terminate at 75% of the peak expiratory flow rate halts alveolar instability. Subsequently, the CPAP Phase maintains alveolar stability and recruits lung volume over time (hours to days).\n\nCopyright 2005 ICON\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 23 -->",
