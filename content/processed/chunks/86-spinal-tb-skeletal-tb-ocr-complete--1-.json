An abscess under tension may assume a globular-shape.\n*   Radiological manifestation of psoas abscess is unilateral or infrequently bilateral widening of the psoas shadow.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 20 -->\n\n\n\n# KYPHOTIC DEFORMITY (ANGULATION OF SPINE WITH CONVEXITY POSTERIORLY)\n\n*   Forward wedging of one or 2 vertebral bodies would produce a small kyphos (knuckle kyphosis), wedge collapse of 3 or more vertebral bodies would produce an angular kyphosis, and moderate wedging of a large number of vertebrae would create a round kyphosis.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 21 -->\n\n\n\n# CENTRAL TYPE OF LESION (TUBERCULOSIS OF THE CENTRUM)\n\n*   The central disease arises as a result of infection which starts from the center of the vertebral body, the infection probably reaches the center through Batson's venous plexus or through the branches of the posterior vertebral artery.\n*   The diseased vertebral body loses the normal bony trabeculae and may show areas of destruction or the body may be expanded or ballooned out like a tumor.\n*   Towards the later stages the diseased vertebral body, however, shows a concentric collapse almost resembling vertebra plana. Diminution of the disc space is minimal and paravertebral shadow is usually not well marked.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 22 -->\n\n\n\n# ANTERIOR TYPE OF LESION\n\nThis lesion occurs when the infection starts beneath the anterior longitudinal ligament and the periosteum.\n\nA tense paravertebral abscess strips and lifts the anterior longitudinal ligament and the periosteum and thus, causes erosion on the surface of the vertebral bodies. More erosion is caused wherever aorta is in close proximity with the paravertebral abscess (thoracic and thoracolumbar regions) thereby permitting transmission of aortic pulsations to the abscess.\n\nCollapse of the vertebral body and diminution of the disc space is usually minimal and occurs late.\n\nThis lesion is relatively more common in thoracic spine in children.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 23 -->\n\n\n\n# APPENDICIAL TYPE OF LESION\n\n*   Isolated tuberculous infection of the pedicles and laminae (neural arch), transverse processes, and spinous process does occur but uncommonly.\n*   Radiographically, these lesions may be appreciated by erosive lesions, paravertebral shadows and intact disc space.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 24 -->\n\nTable 20.2: Clinico-radiological classification of typical tubercular-spondylitis\n\n| Stage | Clinico-radiological features | Usual duration |\n|---|---|---|\n| I.

    "content": "# SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF POTT'S PARAPLEGIA ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE PROXIMAL TO LUMBAR FIRST VERTEBRA\n\n*   Motor functions are almost always affected before and to a greater extent than the sensory functions because the diseased area in the spine lies anterior to the cord thus being nearer to the motor tracts. Besides, probably the motor tracts are more sensitive to compression of the cord.\n*   In very advanced cases of compression, bladder and anal sphincters may be involved and there may be a varying degree of sensory deficit. Sense of position and vibration are the last to disappear.\n*   Exceptionally the damage to the cord may be so sudden and complete that the patient presents with sudden, complete flaccid paralysis like the clinical picture of \"spinal shock\". This may later gradually change into spasticity.\n*   Sudden complete paralysis may be caused by ischemia of the cord due to thromboembolic phenomenon or transection of the cord due to pathological dislocation or extremely rarely due to rapid accumulation of infected material.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 29 -->\n\nChart 22.1: Suggested algorithm for management of vertebral tuberculosis with neurological complications\n\n*   Tuberculous paraplegia or quadriplegia\n    *   Multidrug antitubercular therapy and supervision, rest in recumbency for 3-6 weeks\n        *   **Progressive neurological recovery**\n            *   Continue medications and allow walking once neurological recovery is complete or 3 months after surgery\n        *   **No improvement**\n            *   Surgical decompression\n                *   **Progressive neurological recovery**\n                    *   (Leads back to \"Continue medications and allow walking once neurological recovery is complete or 3 months after surgery\")\n                *   **No neurological recovery**\n                    *   MRI or myelogram\n                        *   **No block**\n                            *   Intrinsic damage to cord had occurred\n                                *   Continue medication and rehabilitate\n                        *   **Block present**\n                            *   Repeat surgical decompression\n                                *   **No recovery**\n                                    *   (Leads back to \"Continue medication and rehabilitate\")\n                                *   **Neurological recovery**\n                                    *   Continue medications and permit walking when recovery is complete\n\nNote: Block is best demonstrated when myelogram is used.

A lesion is considered mechanically unstable if in spite of the arrest of the vertebral disease the patient gets discomfort in the back on doing normal work. Radiologically such lesions may show significant destruction of more than 2 vertebrae and lack of regeneration of vertebral bodies during the process of healing.\n*   Postoperative After decompression or debridement or arthrodesis the patients are nursed on a hard bed, when necessary (for children) a plaster of Paris bed has been used in initial 2 to 3 weeks.\n*   In cases with neural complications 3 to 5 months after the operation when the patient has made good recovery, the patient is gradually mobilized out of the bed with the help of spinal braces. In the absence of paraplegia mobilization with spinal braces is started 3 to 5 months after the operation. The spinal brace is gradually discarded about 12 to 24 months after the operation.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 35 -->\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n---\n\n<!-- Page 36 -->\n\n\n\n# OPERATIVE TREATMENT\n\n*   Cervical spine: Cervical spine is best approached by anterior approach as developed by Smith and Robinson (1958, 1968).\n*   The involved region is explored by working between sternomastoid and carotid sheath laterally, and oesophagus and trachea medially.

Patients with neurological deficits require staging and grading of their deficit on each visit.\n2.  Patients without neurological deficit should be assessed weekly for neurological signs.\n3.  Repeat X-rays of the spine every 3 months.\n4.  Repeat CE-MRI\n    a. After 6 months, if there is suspicion of poor treatment response (but is not required in most)\n    b. At treatment completion (12 months) it would be prudent to assess healing before discontinuation of therapy.\n    c. Findings of quiescent burnt out infection which do not warrant continuation of ATT such as bony/fibrous ankylosis or thin walled cysts without enhancement must be identified.\n5.
